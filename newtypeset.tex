   \section{Notes on the Serpent Sutta}
   
A Sutta with many striking points which perhaps determined the fact that it comes first in this collection. The half-verse refrain notes that it describes a bhikkhu with various attainments. As the great commentator Buddhaghosa explains “bhikkhu” should be taken to mean `anyone who practises mindfulness', that is anyone who is devoted to maintaining mindfulness, the heart of Dharma, in their daily lives.
   
These practitioners `leave here and there': they have left attachment to `here' – this life, as well as `there', any future life. The P\=ali  uses the compound word `orapara', which is literally `this shore or bank and the further shore'.

\begin{itemize}
   
\item[5.] The fifth verse about one who finds no essence (sara) is compared with the lack of flowers upon fig-trees – Udumbara which the PTS Dictionary informs us is Ficus glomerata – needs a little explanation. None of the 800 species of Ficus or fig seems to have flowers, though they all have fruits, one of which is the well-known edible fig. But how could there be fruits without flowers first? The answer to this is that the receptacle, the small green figs, contain inside themselves the flowers which are pollinated there by small wasps, the eggs of which have been laid in there. When pollination has been accomplished the unripe receptacles swell and eventually soften, releasing a generation of small wasps which carry this process on. Trying to find identifiable flowers on Udumbara trees is a waste of time, a misleading venture as apart from the figs themselves there are no flowers. No `essential' flowers can be found.
   
\item[6.] The next verse which has the prase: `this-being-not-being' (itibhavabhavatam) includes all kinds of being or existence, even non-existence. Some people may have craving for non-existence, holding nihilistic theories, rather than the more common craving for various sorts of existence which supports the many views of eternalism. God-worshiping religions general have eternalist views.
   
\item[8-13.] These verses repeat their opening line, `Who neither goes too far nor lags behind' meaning one who does not resort to any sort of extreme. Extremes of views, speech and actions are popular in the world, now and as they were in the Buddha's time, while the Middle Way transcending all extremes is both hard to practise and requires effort and mindfulness. Slipping into extremes is not hard for the latest tendencies towards them are already embedded in our confused minds with their conception of `I am' and `I want'. `Lags behind', or in another translation, `hangs back', refers to attachment, to being and hence to the wrong views of eternalism. `Goes too far' or `overreaches' means the opposite” the extreme of non-being with its views on annihilation. (See the small Sutta at Itivuttaka, Twos, 22). The second lines of these (8-13) verses lists a number of areas in which it is possible to go too far or lag behind. In verse 8 this is `mind-proliferation', papanca, which could not be cured by extreme means. A natural Dharmic cure of papanca is Middle Way but most people, from heads of state round to nameless monks of various kinds, incline to extremes and so create for themselves and others more experience of samsara, more suffering, more conflict. `Mind-proliferation' is not just thinking too much but the indulging in extreme 'solutions' based on ego, defiled mental states and of entrenched tendencies.
   
The next five verses have in their second lines' `who of the world has known, `All is not thus''. This phrase `all is not thus' signifies: the world as it appears to most people is not as they commonly regard it. For instance, though change and impermanence are obvious in everything within the body and outside, yet generally people do not know and see this. They are blind to what they themselves are and blind to the world known through the senses. Those who are free from greed, lust, hate, delusion – they see the world as it is , or All is thus. `All' (sabbam/sarvam), is defined by the Buddha as, eye and sights, ear and sounds, nose and smells, tongue and tastes, body and touches, mind and thoughts. This is the All and no other all can be found. (See, Sn. 35.23, the All Sutta).
   
Verse 14 speaks of latent tendencies (anusaya) which all unenlightened persons have. They are like Melbourne's tram-tracks (or those of trams elsewhere). A tram must stick to its rails, it cannot turn left when the tracks go right. Its way is conditioned by the tracks and in the case of trams there is no possibility of changing that route unless the rails are re-laid. So we trundle along our tracks and never take a new way. We see and do what out latent tendencies permit us to see and do, a great limitation! But there are no limitations for those whose roots of evil (greed, hatred and delusion), `completely are expunged'.
   
Anxiety and fear are part of the ever-turning wheel of birth and death. Where there is the state of samsara there is fear. It is hard for us, enmeshed with fear and anxiety, even to imagine what the state of no-fear can be like. But to experience it we have to allow ego, the I-am view, to disappear. The same may be said for `attachment' in the next verse.
   
In the last, the five hindrances to deep meditation and spiritual experience, have gone – serenity manifests and all doubts are allayed – for one who has Seen what doubts could there be? With no `inner barbs' there is no obstacle to the heart's opening of loving-kindness and compassion.

\section{Notes on the Dhaniya Sutta}
   This translation is based on the work of Ven. Silacara, an English bhikkhu (1871-1950). His translation, slightly amended here, reads well besides being accurate. I first read it in the library of Wat Bovoranives in Bangkok among the volumes of The Buddhist Review published by Luzac \& Co for the Buddhist Society of Great Britain and Ireland before the first World War. Ven. Silacara, at that time the Editor, lived in Burma. I have enjoyed reading at various times and places and would like to honour his memory by including it. To be a bhikkhu at that time was to brave the disapproval of the prevailing imperial culture. May this translation of his at least live on!
   
   This sutta has three characters: Dhaniya, a wealthy owner of cattle who speaks of his domestic and farming concerns, the Budsha whose verses contrast in the ways of Dharma; and Mara who raises his head only to speak one verse but a very important one. Beside this there is one narrative verse to give a picture of the monsoon rains as background to the dialogue.
   
   There are a few interesting points in these verses which call for comments. In the first verse spoken by the Buddha, his statement - 
\begin{MyDescription}[]{}
   	“my house unroofed, my fires in ashes lie”
\end{MyDescription}   
   
   is striking and memorable. As these words were spoken during the monsoon when protection from the elements is most necessary, how could the Buddha say “ my house unroofed”? This phrase puts one in mind of a verse found in the Vinaya:
\begin{MyDescription}[]{}   
   	Rain soddens when the roof is on\\
   	But never when it's opened up.n\\
   	Uncover then what is concealed\\
   	Lest it be soddened by the rain.\\
  	(Vinaya, Cullavagga, IX, 1)
\end{MyDescription}
   This vinaya quotation refers to the modern idea of a `cover-up', that certain facts about oneself should not be known and how those who practise this kind of immorality will become sodden and hence rotten. Buddhas have removed all their concealing coverings for they have nothing left to conceal. It's fine that the roof is off! Similar teachings are contained in the Sanskrit term avarana, translated by Conze as `thought-coverings' though I prefer `obscurations of mind' – the complications and weavings together of all sorts of thoughts: true and false, purified and defiled, open and concealed. These `coverings' are also related to the famous Buddhist term `papanca', multiplicity of thoughts or conceptual proliferation. Finally in this group of related matters dealing with coverings, there is the image of the Buddha Samantabhadra, aways depicted naked – nothing covered up and sky-blue in colour symbolizing space. He may or may not be accompanied by his consort , also naked and joined in bliss, the union of wisdom and compassion with nothing to hide.
   
   The second of the Buddhas's verses contains reference to the famous raft simile which appears complete at M.22. The raft made up of Dharma learned and practised and bound up with actions of body and speech which lead out of bondage is to be paddled across from this shore of samsarsa to the further shore of Nirvana. When that has been experienced the raft is no longer needed, it should be left on the nirvana shore or set adrift there – not carried around any longer. The Dharma liberates even from its own concepts. It liberates from all attachments, even from attachment to the Dharma. Of course this does not mean that one then neglects one's teachers or disowns the Dharma by which one has crossed over. Others will need the raft fro their won jounryes while a natural gratitude for the HDarma manifests in those who have seen it for themselves. The standard rendering of M.22 in “The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha” unfortunately contains a mistranslation of the important last sentence of the simile (par. 14), which should read, “When you know the Dharma to be similar to a raft, you should abandon even the Dharma, how much more so not-dharma”. The published version is based upon the Commentaries of Buddhaghosa and is not what the P\=ali  text says. “Of well-made raft what further need have I?” – indeed!
   
   “evil in me, what searcher can espy?” The P\=ali  plainly rendered would translate as `evil in me cannot be found'. However, the translation used here reminds us of M.47, The Inquirer with its question, “are there found in the Tathagatha, or not, any defiled states cognizable through the eye or through the ear?”
   
   “I walk all the worlds with what I've earned in mind.” The venerable's translation has “I walk the world content with what I find”. The P\=ali  text has `all worlds – sabbeloke' while the verb (carati) has the meaning both of `travel, journey' and of `progress along a spiritual path'. Buddhas are able to review or investigate all states of existence though we usually have access only to the human and animal realms and even of these know little enough. `In mind' is not found in the P\=ali  though the Buddhas's `earnings' are certainly in mind, not of worldly gains.
   
   The two lines beginning, `Like bull', have been retranslated. The `stinky-vine' is some tough and malodorous liana in the forest. The third line originally reads, “No more shall I put on mortality” which is not a great rendering of the P\=ali , so I have replaced it with `Ne'er again I'll enter in a womb to lie'.
   
   Coming now to the last two verses of the Sutta, the first two lines of each of them have not been revised except to replace `hath' with `has'. The second pair of lines concern upadhi, a P\=ali  word conveying the meaning of `basis' or `support'. P\=ali  Commentaries have elaborated the meanings of this word and given it a far greater range. The original transalator used `being' as a rendering of upadhi, but this is too loose. Ven. Nyanamoli has suggested `assets' as a possible translation and this is fine so long as we remember that `assets' must include what we think we own in body, in mind as well – My body, My mind – as well as external possessions.
 \begin{MyDescription}[]{}
 “Man's assets, these of all his woes are chief,\\
   who has no assets nevermore has grief.”

\section{Notes for Rhinos}
   
This excellent sutta is famous throughout Buddhist traditions in various forms and deserves a good metric translation. In general few notes are needed as its meaning is clear, direct and straight to the point. This point is repeated in the fourth line of most verses, but will not appeal to those who do not esteem, even for part of their lives, its eremitic message. Though there are still monks who prefer the solitary life they are few compared to those who live in monastic settlements. And some lay scholars too may find shelter from the world's assaults for their study and practice and become `single-horned rhinos'. The rhinoceros is remarkable in India for its single horn as opposed to the twin horns of cattle, deer and so on. It is not that one should be `single as the rhinoceros' as some translators have it. In fact the animals are usually found in groups but their horns are only one.
The few notes below are preceded by their Sn. verse number.
I am very much in debt to E. M. Hare's translation of Sn. in `Woven Cadences' and have borrowed many of his good ideas though modifying them, and in his honour one whole verse, Sn. 57.
44. Kovil\=ara trees are these days called Bauhinia species. Their leaves are remarkable for their two leaflets joined at a single point. Many species open and close these two as the sun rises and sets. So their `parting' is demonstrated every day.
49. `A second one', literally `with a second' is a Pali idiom for a wife, the use of which here reminds me of `me old trouble (and strife)'!
50. Both `sense-objects' and `sense-desires' are translations of the Pali word k\=ama. This word is explained in the commentary of the K\=ama Sutta, Sn IV.1 or verses 766–771.
54. `E'en timely freedom cannot find' refers to k\=ala-vimutti, a freedom found temporarily and usually explained as the experience of jh\=ana. This contrasts with a vimutti or freedom beyond time, a liberation from all bondage. The `Kinsman of the Sun', Ādiccabandhu, is an epithet of the Buddha.
58. There seems to be, in this verse, a conflict between having a friend who is deeply learned and practised – a teacher in fact, and the refrain on faring singly. However, if one has the good fortune to meet and perhaps stay with such a teacher then when it is time to practise alone, one's retreat will be much more fruitful. With or without a teacher in our minds, we still have to `fare singly as the rhino's horn'.
64. Another tree, the Parichatta, is today known as the Erythrina indica, the species in general called Coral Trees. Most have spectacular red flowers borne on deciduous branches. They shed leaves before flowers appear. The leaves are here compared to the possessions of ordinary people (who are usually attached to them!) while the magnificent flowers which follow are hinted at by the words of the third line. `K\=asaya' robes refers to various vegetable dyes which will give robes of a yellow (many monks in Sri Lanka), reddish-brown (as in Burma) or yellowish-brown colour as used by the forest meditation monks of Thailand. These earthy colours remind practitioners of their own connection with the earth-element.
69. `What's in a line with Dharma do' tries to translate the frequently occurring `dhamm\=anudhammapatipatti', literally, `practising the Dharma according to the Dharma' and is opposed to the commonly held path of `practising the Dharma according to oneself', a very different kettle of fish. The Dharma which should be accorded with is the Dharma of what is true without any belief being necessary.
Examples:
`All conditioned things (and conditions) are impermanent
All conditioned things are dukkh\=a.
All dharmas are not self, or empty of self.'
These self-evident truths may have to be pointed out first but after deep insight (vipassan\=a) practice will be known from a practitioner's meditative experience. `Practising Dharma is the best practice of generosity, moral conduct, loving kindness and compassion with all beings near and far, human and non-human. That becomes `according to the Dharma' with awakening or breakthrough experiences. No views of any kind are held, grouped, or believed by those who have seen things as they really are, not even `Buddhist' views.
Also on 69. `and mastered existential fears' translates also as the fears of being or becoming. These may be experienced indirectly through reports in newspapers and other media of murder, wars, plagues, starvation, and all manner of inhumane conduct; or they may sometimes touch more closely on one's life. Many fears indeed! Being or becoming are also illustrated by the famous Indian painting (now Tibetan) of the Wheel of birth and death, showing the various realms of being and what one may, by making appropriate karma, experience there.
73. To pack the four Divine Abidings (Brahma-vih\=ara) into two short lines is not easy! Mett\=a or loving-kindness is usually translated has been left in the Pali for obvious reasons. Next, karun\=a or compassion has had to be expressed by the little-used `ruth'. (Maybe it is a comment on this world that we still employ `ruthless' but have forsaken `ruth'?) The third of these meditative abidings is joy but particularly the joy with others' happiness, a reflection for which we have no English word. (Does this mean we are singularly envious people?) The P\=ali word is mudit\=a. Last, upekkh\=a or equanimity is squashed into the second line as `those poised'. Still being equanimous it will not mind being so treated.
This sutta does not identify the teacher who composed and recited it. Presumably these were the Buddha's words! The first sutta in the book also records no speaker.
   
    
   \chapter{Kasībh\=aradv\=aja Sutta –- The Farmer Bharadvaja}
   
Thus have I heard:
As one time the Radiant One was dwelling among the Magadhans at South Mountain near the brahmin village of Ekan\=ala. Now at that time the brahmin Kasī-bh\=aradv\=aja had five hundred ploughts fastened to their yokes at the time of `planting'. Then in the morning the Radiant One dressed and, taking bowl and robe, went to the place where the brahmin Kasī-bh\=aradv\=aja was working.
As that time the brahmin Kasī-bh\=aradv\=aja 's food distribution was happening. Then the Radiant One approached the place for the distribution of food and stood to one side. The brahmin Kasī-bh\=aradv\=aja saw the Radiant One standing for alms as said to him:
"Samana, I plough and plant, and when I have ploughed and planted, I eat. You too, samana, ought to plough and plant; then when you have ploughed and planted, you will eat.”
“But I too, brahmin, plough and plant, and when I have ploughed and planted, I eat.”
“But we do not see Master Gotama's yoke or plough or ploughshare or goad or oxen; yet Master Gotama says, “I too brahmin, plough and plant, and when I have ploughed and planted, I eat.”
Then the brahmin Kasī-bh\=aradv\=aja addressed the Radiant One in verse:
   
\begin{MyDescription}[\arabic{stanza}]{}
`A ploughman so you claim to be\\
   but we see not your ploughmanship.\\
   If you're a ploughman, answer me,\\
   make clear your ploughmanship!”
   \stepcounter{stanza}
\end{MyDescription}

\begin{MyDescription}[\arabic{stanza}]{The Buddha:}
`With faith as seed and practice,\\

\end{MyDescription}
   
\begin{MyDescription}[\arabic{stanza}]{}
My harnessed ox is energy –\\

\begin{MyDescription}[\arabic{stanza}]{}

\end{MyDescription}
   
Then Kasī-bh\=aradv\=aja had a large bronze bowl filled with milk-rice and brought to the Radiant One. “May it please Master Gotama to eat the milk-rice, Master Gotama is a ploughman since he does the ploughing that has the Deathless as its crop.'
   
\begin{MyDescription}[\arabic{stanza}]{The Buddha:}

\end{MyDescription}
   
When this was said the brahmin Kasī-bh\=aradv\=aja exclaimed to the Radiant One: `Magnificent, Master Gotama! The Dharma has been clarified by Master Gotama in many ways, as though he was righting what had been overturned, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding a lamp in the dark so that those with eyes could see forms. I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the Dharma and to the Sangha. May Master Gotama remember me as an up\=asaka who from today has gone for Refuge for life.'

\section{Notes on the Farmer Bharadvaja Sutta}
   
This famous small sutta appears twice in the P\=ali canon, once here and again in the Samyutta-nik\=aya (see translation at the Connected Discourse of the Buddha, Book One, VII.2.1). This present translation varies from it, necessitating some notes.
First of these concerns the cultivation of rice. Most of my readers will be aware that unlike other grain crops – wheat, oats, barley, maize, etc – which are planted with dry seed straight into the prepared field, rice requires first to be planted into a flooded nursery bed and then when the seedlings are ready, re-planted in small clumps in a flooded field. Water must be maintained at the proper level throughout its growth, only beginning to dry out with the ripening of the grain.
The prose introduction of this sutta informs us that the farmer-brahmin, a wealthy landowner able to muster `five hundred' ploughmen and oxen, (`500' in Pali means `a lot, many') was that time celebrating `Vappak\=ala', the time (k\=ala) of Vappa. But what is meant by Vappa? The translation given by the PTSD and followed by all translators is `sowing' but as we have seen above, rice is not sown in the way of other grains. If a religious celebration involving many men and oxen with (probably chanting by Brahmins) and the offering of cooked milk-rice for all, is called for this seems to be the planting of the seedlings rather than the ploughing of the land. The verb for `ploughing' is `kasati' though in the case of rice this should include operations other than the initial breaking of the soil with ploughs. The mud of the field must be smooth and without lumps, so it is harrowed. This is all `kasati' – to prepare the soil. It is followed by `vapati', the verb for planting or sowing though the farmer is not mentioned in PTSD. 
   
So at this vappak\=ala what is going on? Fields had already been flooded, ploughed, with perhaps harrowing in progress. The backbreaking work of planting, traditionally women's work, though this is not mentioned here, would be in progress. The wealthy farmer dressed in his best and newest white cloth would be issuing orders and coordinating the whole operation while also superintending the rituals ensuring that there would be a good crop. A large amount of milk-rice had been prepared for the various religious `wanderers' and also for Brahmins. Part of this would also be set aside for the labourers.
In this translation `sowing' is not mentioned, its place being taken by planting'.
The Buddha's first verse of explanation begins `With faith as seed ...' The Pali word which translates as `faith' is saddh\=a (Skt Raddh\=a). The meaning of faith to most people is equivalent to `belief' but in a Buddhist sense saddh\=a does not mean belief. Belief involves accepting certain formulations of words as representing the truth. And in this world there are many such `truths' (see Sn. 884-886) underlain by belief, none of them verifiable, many of them at odds with others and hence the basis for many conflicts between believers, political or religious, even for persecution, torture and wars. Throughout the Suttas the Buddha has emphasised that holding views, attachment to them (even Buddhist ones) departs from the path of Dharma. One must know through personal experience involving wisdom, not merely believe. Saddh\=a, therefore, is a tricky word to translate and sometimes `faith' must be used. Other possible translations are `confidence' and `assurance' but neither has quite the range of meaning of saddh\=a.
Tapo, translated `practice' means to a brahmin `severe austerities' or at least a very austere mode of life. Buddhists have softened the word to mean steady Dharma practice. As the Buddha is teaching a brahmin who would not understand the higher meanings of pa\~n\~na/praj\~na I have not translated it as wisdom. But among the three steps of pa\~n\~na there is suta-masya-pa\~n\~na – the wisdom acquired by listening or learning, a feature of all Indian religions and well-known to the brahmin. In the last line of this verse `memory' is a possible translation of sati/smrti, another word well-known to brahmins. Also smrti, `that which is remembered' is used in Hindu tradition as a name of the collection of commentarial works, as opposed to the holier god-given corpus of Vedas and Upanishads known as `sruti', `that which has been heard'.
My knowledge of horticulture or perhaps agriculture has aided the translation of the second verse. I have paid little attention to the P\=ali Commentary's suggestions as these do not appear to make much sense.
The third verse is beautiful and its profound but straightforward meaning very moving. `Yokings End' is liberation.
It is not surprising that the brahmin having heard these four spontaneous verses is greatly impressed. In fact, he has been convinced that the Buddha is indeed also a cultivator who ploughs and plants but that his crop (literally `fruit') is the Deathless (amata/amrta). He wishes then to offer some of the specially prepared milk-rice to the Buddha in a large copper bowl, no doubt as a mark of his respect.
But to this invitation the Buddha replies in an unexpected way, saying that he does not chant sacred verses to gain food – presumably a thing done by many brahmins then. Actually they would be inconvenient to present day monks who if they kept to the Buddha's practice, would lose many a good morning meal. The meaning of this verse is very straightforward.
This cannot be said of the second verse, which appears to mean that Awakened persons are fit recipients of food and will be a `certain field for one who merit seeks' – in other words, donors will make good karma by offerings given to such people. Perhaps this verse is added later by monks to pad against the impact of the previous verse. In any case there is conflict between these two verses.
I have chosen the shorter version of this sutta from Samyutta-nik\=aya, rather than the text in Sn. The latter adds an incident in which the good brahmin wishes to known to whom he could offer the rice. The Buddha replies that he knows not a single person who could receive it and advises the brahmin to put it in water or in the bush where no living thing can be harmed by it. The brahmin in doing this finds that as it is poured into water it boils sizzling and hissing with much steam, so that the brahmin trembles and his hair stands on end. At the conventional end of the sutta in this version the brahmin does not ask for the Refuges and becomes an up\=asaka, but requests the leaving home with ordination as a bhikkhu.
It seems likely that the Sn. version is an expansion of a more ancient and simpler original now found in S. The magical addition of boiling milk-rice tipped into a stream seems a glorification of the Buddha done by later hands. This decided me not to translate the Sn. version.
Portions of the Commentary's explanations are translated into English in the Connected Discourses of the Buddha (Vol. 1), see notes 446 following on p. 446. There are rather astonishing remarks in these `explanations', for the P\=ali commentator has apparently had access to the Buddha's thoughts (!) no doubt a very useful trick for ascertaining the truth of any problematic statement in the Suttas. To preface any `explanation' with the words `This was his (the Buddha's) thought' is a claim to know precisely what an Awakened One was thinking. How could the truth be found in this way?

\section{A Few Words}
   
A rather strange little sutta in which the Buddha answers the questions of the Smith Cunda. He wishes to be clear about what sorts of monks there are. In the Buddha's days there were a great variety of monks, some of who wandered in groups, others who were solitary, some who had monasteries, others who dwelt in caves or hollow trees. Their doctrines varied even more and in the Discourse of the Buddha these are examined as `ditthi' or views and sometimes revealed as `wrong views'.
   
The Buddha on this occasion limits the sorts of monks to his own samanas, further limiting them to four and rather oddly adding “not a fifth is found”. This of course acknowledges the four sorts of monk, which the Buddha knows exist among his own Sangha. One may assume that what is true of the first three kinds of monks – bhikkhus, plus the fourth who is really not a bhikkhu, may also be found among the bhikkunis. Stories of recalcitrant monks and nuns may be found in plenty in the Vinaya for both bhikkhus and bhikkunis. The four sorts of monks and briefly described below.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Won to the Path. This appears to be a practitioner who has for the first time experienced what is truly the Noble Path (ariya-magga). They are the beyond doubt and have lost all greed. Also, lost is ownership for though these monks who have won to the Path they do not own it. In fact, having experienced suchness, the way all things really are they can let go of everything.
   
\item Indicator of the Path is the best of teachers of Dharma – they teach Dharma out of their deep experience of it. Who knows the best is truly awakened. He teaches with clarity, as those of his students know well and is a man who analyses accurately so that no misunderstanding can occur. They no longer have doubts about things that to ordinary persons seem either worth no understanding or are taken for granted. They point to matters most obvious, like impermanence, which in general are not noticed.
   
\item	“Who lives on the Way, the well-taught Dharma Path”. This kind of monk is learned and his actions agree with the teachings in the Suttas as well as those of those famous living Teachers. So wether from their Teachers or from Suttas the Dharma is “well taught”. This expression means that at first it is derived from the Buddha and his disciples: all of their uttered words are derived from the Enlightenment – Bodhi. They had woken up and spoke the non-basis of Awakening. Their truth is not that of speculations and `views'. As an example:

\begin{MyDescription}[]{}   
   “All conditioned thing are impermanent,\\
   All conditioned things are dukkha,\\
   All dharmas are not-self (and empty)”
\end{MyDescription}
\item Those who pretend to be bhikkhus but actually are corrupted. That this type of monk is included with the other three shows the honesty of the Buddha. If he had referred to monk number four as only to be found among the ascetics of other teachers that would have been a sort of dishonesty but the Buddha knew quite well that he had corrupt monks in his Sangha. Though it is hard to believe that corrupt monks could live near to the Buddha's presence, because of course he had the power of reading the minds of others, still some monks were (and are) shameless and thoroughly corrupt in their dealings. It is not so surprising that such monks can be found in our days. The Buddha points them out with these characteristics – 
\begin{description}
\item[a)]They pretend by copying the ways of those who keep their precepts,
\item[b)]They are deceitful, and trying to corrupt others,
\item[c)]Worthless – of receiving the gifts of honest practitioners,
\item[d)]Quite unrestrained means that they indulge even in the pleasures usually sanctioned by society
\item[e)]Insolent and braggarts, hardly needs any comments,
\item[f)]“Family-defilers”, leaves one's mind to many possibilities.
\end{description}      
\end{enumerate}   
    
\chapter{Par\=abhava Sutta -- Disaster}
   
Thus have I heard: At one time the Radiant one was dwelling at Jeta's Grove in the park of Anathapindika near Savatthi. Then as the night was ending a deva of surpassing radiance, illuminating the whole of Jeta's Grove, went up to the Radiant One and stood to one side after saluting him. Standing there that deva addressed the Radiant One with a verse:
   
\begin{MyDescription}[\arabic{stanza}]{Deva:}

\section{Commentary}
   
   This translation was first published in the newsletter, Bodhi leaf, of Wat Buddha Dhamma, Vol 2, No.4, 1986. I enjoyed translating it, partly because of its rhyme- the P\=ali original has no rhyme – and partly the contents, the truths of which are not confined to the Buddha's days! The setting of this sutta reminds me of the Sag\=atha-vagga, the Book with Verses, of the Samyutta-nik\=aya, the Connected Discourses\footnote{See Volume 1 of the Connected Discourses of the Buddha}. There, as in the present discourses, a deva asks questions of the Buddha. In this case it is within a stylised framework of the deva's acknowledging the Buddha's replies and asking further advice on, “what's the way to disasters woe?” This particular repeated line in P\=ali: kim par\=abhavato mukhaṁ has a nice swing to it which I sought to repeat. However, par\=abhavato mukhaṁ is not easily translated. `Mukha' means entrance, mouth, face, while `par\=abhava'  has the sense of decline or disaster, so the entrance or way to disaster. The whole sutta, though it contains very straightforward advice, is like a game between the playful deva and the Buddha who frames his replies in verses which end “that's the way to disasters woe”. This fits well with the what we know of deva who traditionally are taught the Dharma by singing and acting it. The `lower' devas of the Sense- realm at any rate, were used to pleasures and could only respond to Dharma teaching through singing it using such playful verbal presentations as in this sutta. Presumably, since conditions in this world are infinitely variable, the Buddha could have gone on all day with this numerical game but perhaps he thought that the deva had enough material on the causes of dukkha (not many devas, or even human beings for that matter, are much interested in this), to be getting along with. The sutta closes with the twelfth way to disaster's woe.
   The content of the sutta – from Dharma and its teachers, through family and social considerations, to the corruption of politicians, is especially wide-ranging and it would be possible to write a long commentary with suitable stories from such sources as the Suttas, Dhammapada Commentary and the J\=atakas as well as from our own times on these ways to disaster's woe.
   The rhyme which I think adds to its colour and swing, and possibly to its ease of leaning by heart, was possible given the pattern of the sutta's verses. I have not attempted rhyme elsewhere in this Sutta nip\=ata translation.
   
   \chapter{Vasala Sutta –- Who is the Outcaste?}
   
   Thus have I heard:
   At one time the Radiant One was dwelling at S\=avatthi in the Jeta Grove – Anathapindika's Park. Then in the morning the Radiant One dressed and, taking bowl and robes, entered S\=avatthi, for almsfood. At that time the sacrificial fire was burning in the house of the brahmin Aggika-bh\=aradv\=aja and the offering was held aloft. Then the Radiant One walking in almsround, house by house within S\=avatthi, came to the house of brahmin Aggika-bh\=aradv\=aja. The brahmin saw the Radiant One coming from a distance and called out this to him: `Stop there, mere shaveling, stop there, vile ascetic, stop there, foul outcaste!' When this was said, the Radiant One said to the brahmin: `Do you know, brahmin, what an outcaste is or what things make a person `outcaste'?'
   `I do not know good Gotama what an outcaste is or what things make one an outcaste. It would be good for me if the venerable Gotama were to teach me Dharma, so that I might know an outcaste and what things make an outcaste'
   `Then listen, brahmin, pay attention and I shall tell you'
   `Yes, venerable sir', replied the brahmin.

\section{Commentary}
`Vasala', the name of this sutta, is one of the many words in P\=ali and Sanskrit for `outcastes', those people which tradition, and in the past, high-caste laws, declared to be beneath the four basic castes or vaṇṇa/varna. These four, brahmana (priests with cattle), khattiya/ksatriya (warrior nobility, kings), vessa/vaiśa (merchants, traders) and sudda/śūdra (workers) are proclaimed by Hindu Law books to be a God-given ordering of society. Outcastes of various sorts were considered below even the śūdras. 
As to the state of these outcastes, a passage from my earlier book `Noble Friendship', outlines some of the terrible disabilities.
Many barbarous rules made by the higher castes featured in a Dalit's (outcaste's) life. They could not even pass in front of Hindu temples, much less enter them; they had to wear cast-off rags, never good clothes; they had the duty of clearing away dead animals as well as removing human excrement; in some places they were forced to wear clay pots round their necks  so that their spittle would not reach the ground, while their footsteps were obliterated by a broom tied to their waists; their women folk were compelled to wear non-precious jewellery of iron or pottery; their children had to be given `ugly' names, and finally they could not venture outdoors when the shadows were long lest their shadow fall on a high-caste person and pollute him. This fear of ritual pollution, very characteristic of Caste Hindus, underlies all these suppressive rules. It is easy to understand that people who have been so treated for hundreds of years, with no chance fro education or self-improvement, would feel that their lives were a hopeless round of degradation. Brahmins emphasized that they had been born onto such `low' births because of their sins – in other words, they were to be humble menials, do the dirty work, and say nothing. Some groups of outcastes were so polluting to the eyes of Hindus that they were not only untouchable but `unseeable' as well. There was bitter saying among the outcaste groups deriding caste hypocrisy that goes as follows: male Untouchables are always untouchables but female Untouchables, untouchable by day, became touchable by night. Perhaps the most suppressive rule of them all forbade low-caste people and Untouchables to have any religious education of practice. Religion, largely controlled by the Brahmins, involved the learning of Sanskrit, and as this reckoned to be the `root-language' spoken by the Hindu gods, it was utterly forbidden for outcastes to even to hear it, let alone learn it.' (Noble Friendship, p.39)
Even worse was the penalty prescribed for outcastes who heard brahmins chanting in Sanskrit: molten lead was to be poured into their ears. Whatever religion outcastes had was their own mixture of ritual, their own mantras (presumably not in Sanskrit) administered by their own priests who will rarely have been literate: a sort of low-grade Hinduism.
Whereas in Hinduism there is a widespread dread of ritual pollution caused by exterior factors such as low-caste persons as mentioned above, also by restrictive brahminical injunctions, such as the rule that those of high caste will lose their `purity' by crossing the ocean, the Buddha's teaching on purity emphasize that this depends on the karmas made by body, speech and mind, and ultimately by mind. So in this sutta we see the Buddha listing all the actions which make one an `outcaste', all them amoral, harmful to others and generally censured by the world. Thus, one may have high-caste brahmins who by the Buddha's standards are `outcaste', as well as those born as `outcastes' who in fact are people of great nobility of character, such as Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar. The Buddha did occasionally say that such people were `brahmana' or `Brahmins', meaning Awake or Enlightened. ( See the verses in the Vasettha Sutta, 620-647 in Ch.III). Mere words of praise and blame have no ultimate truth. Words must be accompanied by compassionate actions.
The introductory prose section shows the Buddha going on almsround with his bowl `house by house', that is, he stopped briefly before each door to see if anyone wished to give alms of cooked food. This practice shows clearly that he had none of the Hindu prejudice that cooked by low-caste persons would be `polluted' and its consumption the cause of high-caste, such as brahmins, losing their status. The well-known brahmin Aggik\=a-bh\=aradv\=aja, as he later addressed the Buddha as Gotama, knew who he was and that he came from a high-caste warrior-noble family. At that time this brahmin was engaged in a fire-sacrifice ritual (notice the `aggika' – of fire, in his name) and had lifted the portion to be placed in the sacred fire when he saw the Buddha approaching. The latter was abused by the brahmin who feared that the benefits of the sacrifice would be lost due to the presence of a man who accepted food from low-caste and outcaste people. `Mere shaveling' (mundaka) was abusive as brahmins kept some or all of their hair and looked down upon those, like Buddhist monks and nuns, who shaved it off (Whethe the Buddha shave his head is rather a disputed matter as attested by all the images of the Buddha showing him with hair). `Vile ascetic' (samaṇaka) showed brahmin disapproval of those who left home and had a wandering religious life. Some of these will have been low-caste people as there were in the Buddha's Sangha. Last `vasalaka' as a word of abuse emphasizing low-casteness, means literally `little man', hence an insignificant person.
When the Buddha in reply asks him whether he knows who is an outcaste or what are the qualities which make a person so, the brahmin, rather surprisingly, says that he does not. Moreover, he addresses the Buddha quite politely as `venerable Gotama' though this is a familiar speech as to an equal. What could have brought about this sudden change in attitude?
We should leave aside the possibility that the Buddha used one of his powers or abilities to influence the brahmin. He preferred not to employ these unless there was a situation in which ordinary means would not serve. See for instance his remarks in Digha-nik\=aya, 11, Kevaddha Sutta. As it seems unlikely that this brahmin's attitude was changed by super-natural means we have to fall back upon what could be generally described as `the Buddha's presence'. This is well illustrated by what happened as the Buddha approached the five monks who were to be his first disciples soon after his Awakening. Though they had made a pact with each other that they would no longer treat him as a Teacher (because he had given up starvation and was again eating), as he approached, they all rose and performed the duties of pupils towards teachers. We may assume that the Buddha's presence, regardless of the brahmin's prejudices about food, turned his mind to civility. The Buddha was praised for his handsome features, radiant complexion and height (see vv.548-553 in Sela Sutta below).
Towards the end of this sutta occurs the famous verse, twice repeated:

\begin{MyDescription}[]{}
One's not an outcaste caused by `birth',\\
not by `birth' a brahmin is;\\
caused by karma one's outcaste,\\
a brahmin is by karma caused.
\stepcounter{stanza}
\end{MyDescription}      

Brahmins in the Buddha's days and some maybe even now, were wont to say that they were pure back through seven generations in both the mother's and the father's family. All of these people, they were claiming, had married only into other brahmin families and hence they were `pure'. The Buddha by no means agreed with this estimation of purity and has, in the suttas, made fun of brahmin arrogance. To know one's ancestors back through seven generations on both mother's and father's sides is quite unusual even now – unless one comes from an aristocratic family, so brahminical claims for so-called purity – ring rather hollow. This claim of superiority through birth is not confined to brahmins in the Buddha's time, as we can attain from the radio and television news of notions of superiority and the conflicts arising from it in our own time.
It is related to the claim to be an Aryr/ariya – those who are noble by race. The Buddha again does accept such claims, the likes of which have lasted in our time, notably in the causes of WWII and the slaughter of millions of people. One is noble by practising the Noble Eightfold Path, one is ennobled by Dharma, not by lineage or race.
The sutta concludes with one of the stylised passages which are characteristic of orally-transmitted works. Presumably the brahmin of this sutta was impressed and praised the Buddha's teaching. There is no reason to suppose that he spoke exactly the words exactly translated here which appear hundreds of time at the end of suttas. Whether he went to for refuge in the formula quoted here, or indeed, whether he went in any sense for refuge at all is something that we shall never know.
Three points in the sutta may be remarked upon: one a minor matter and the others weightier. Verse 117 mentions the term `twice born'. This means a man from high castes who has not only been born in the normal way but has also received a `second birth' in the ceremony of being invested with a scared thread, usually at puberty. Brahmins, for instance are `twice born'. The rest of us remain `once born' and so of lower status. Workers and outcastes (and those not touched by the Indian caste-system) are merely `once born'.
Of greater importance in the next verse which declares very straight-forwardly (for the ears of heads of state or generals0, that if they behave, as they have commonly done in history, by invasion of other lands and slaughter, they should be known as outcastes. One or two notable examples will make clear this Buddhist attitude to war: We have an Alexander who is even honoured with the epithet `Great'. By the standards of verse 118, he should be known as `Alexander the Outcaste'. As for modern times, one may choose from a long list which will no doubt include Napoleon, Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin and Moa Tsetung – outcastes all.
Also in v.126 there is the line ` teaching in obscurities', a phrase covering a multitude of errors. It may mean teaching which will confuse other while promoting the so-called teacher's ego, implying he or she has Dharma attainments which do not exist.Or this may mean teaching an obscure and useless subject from the viewpoint of Dharma. As an example there is the brahmin `science' of marks or characteristics to be found on animals or people. Such `marks', such as a mole on the cheek, are claimed to be characteristic of those who cheat and lie. Such `science' (vijj\=a/vidy\=a) is not based on any cause and effect considerations. Connected to this in modern times, there is a small P\=ali treatise in verse, on the marking upon cats, a playful and unusual subject, written by a Sanghar\=aja of what was then Siam and now Thialand!
Elephants have also been the subject s of such a `science' of markings and their meanings. These matters are not exactly essential Dharma, and may well be regarded as obscurities.

\chapter{Mett\=a Sutta –- Loving-kindness}
What should be done by one who's skilled in wholesomeness, to gain the State of Peacefulness is this:
One should be able, upright, straight and not proud,
easy to speak to, mild and well content,
easily satisfied and not caught up 
in too much bustle, and frugal in one's ways,
with senses calmed, intelligent, not bold,
not being covetous when with other folk,
not even doing little things that otherwise ones blame. (And this the thought that one should always hold):

 \section{Commentary}
   
   The State of Peacefulness, appears at the opening of this sutta and is implies in the last verse. It may in other contexts be referred to as Nirvana, liberation and so on. In between the first and last verses we find a number of conditions mentioned for attainment of the Peaceful State. There is no trace in this sutta of a `method', such as the Pali commentary presents and which is also explained in the Visuddhimagga, `The Path of Perfection', for attainment of this goal, a fact that we shall return to later.
   
   In the sutta's first line there is a clear indication of what is needed for experience of the Peaceful State: skill in wholesomeness, in other words, good conduct with body, speech and mind. This is followed by a passage listing fifteen requirements – things that one should work on and make effort with – but as they are straightforward little needs to written about them, though the following remarks may be useful. `Able' refers to a person who can do and is willing to try. `Upright' and `straight' refer, we are told, respectively to the moral behaviour with body and speech, and the same with mind. However, they may also be taken as repetitive emphasis on the importance of general honesty. With mention of `well content, easily satisfied and frugal in one's ways' we come to factors more easily practised by monks, or while on a long retreat. These three go against the current of worldliness and materialism. The ministers in charge of economic development in various countries would not be happy if large numbers of their populations began to practice them. Not being `bold' means foolishly over-estimating one's capacity and taking big steps which one cannot follow - generally based on a mixture of pride and delusion. Not wanting what others have is good for peace of mind, so not being covetous when visiting others' houses and so on is very helpful. Wise ones, like spiritual teaches, have developed their minds and can aware of the consequences of doing `little things'. Their `blame' is expressed to their unwise students often in private. This does not refer to wholesale condemnations.
   The line in brackets is not part of the text but is needed to link the fifteen requirements with the next part upon the various kinds of beings to which Mett\=a should be extended. They are defined by having `breath of life' though this does not mean only those having lungs or gills as the P\=ali word `p\=ana' (pr\=ana in Sandskrit) means not only breathing but also living. Examples of creatures fitting the following list of adjectives can easily be thought of, until we come to `dense or visible or invisible'. This could be rendered `those which are substantial, those that can be seen and those that cannot'. In the context of Dharma the last means, those that the human eye cannot see.' Rationalists might want this to mean `those that require a microscope' and though this would be a possible it is not in accordance with tradition. This definitely means `those with bodies too refined for the human eye to see', devas for instance or ghosts. Awareness of such beings increases with depth of meditation practice. `Dwelling far or near' may be taken to mean `those beings whose bodies (or non-bodies in the case of the formless-realm devas) are remote from our experience, while `near' signifies those whose existence overlaps our own experience (as with animals), or are `near' to us because of former relationships, as with some ghosts and devas which may act as guides or protectors.
   Next comes an interesting line: `those that are here, those seeking to exist'. Strict Therav\=ada philosophy upon life after death departs from the main line of Indian Buddhist teaching. The Therav\=ada Abhidhamma analyses all experience into momentary dharmas, a doctrine which rationalizes the teaching of not-self and defends the notion that nothing in terms of a being (which contradicts the idea of not-self) goes from life to life. The trouble is that often no distinction is drawn between the two kinds of truth: conditional and ultimate. Rebirth belongs to the realm of conditional truth within which we usually live. To say that `so-and-so has gone to heaven' may be quite correct according to conditional and dualistic truth. The phrase may seem to imply that this person will be the same there as he or she was here except that they have a new and less visible body. This view would be on the side of eternalism, one of two extremes which the Buddhist Dharma-in-the-Middle avoids. Moreover, such a view seems to ignore the first of the three characteristics (lakkhana) of all conditioned things: Impermence. So a phrase like `Go to Hell!' besides showing little loving-kindness and a good deal of hate, is true in its dualistic limitations: Someone should go to Hell.
   Ultimate truth in its Abhidhamma from suggest that because there are no beings, only moments of experience, then no one goes from one life to another. This theory denies that there is anyone who goes and comes, perilously near to the other extreme of nihilism. It has led Therav\=ada scholars to deny that there is any experience between lives, a teaching which is widely found in the various Indian (extinct) Buddhist sects and in Mah\=ayana.
   The concept of the `between-life' or antarabhava, usually known these days by convenient Tibetan translation: Bardo, is a agglomeration of commonsense, ESP, memory of past lives and vision of famous living teachers. The commonsense (or conditional truth) is that so-and-so died and because this person made karma  of some kind, will be reborn accordingly. The extra-sensory perception will be the visions and sensations of that being who has died by those who were close to him or her, that suggest that the deceased is still in some way present. Memory of past lives and the linking periods between them may be the experience of some people, a recollection which comes with clarity of mind, quite different from the confusions of desire and imagination.
   The visions of living Teachers may explore the processes of being reborn during the intermediate state and give disciples instructions upon how to practise, achieve liberation in that state. Teachings on the Bardo are mostly about the later. Though it is useful to have books explaining perception after human death, the transmission of that practice from living teacher is really required.
   So `those that are here' are all the beings that we can be aware of in our present life. `Those seeking to exist' are those in the Bardo seeking existence through the limitations of their karmas.
   Buddhaghosa the Pali commentator who lived about a thousand years after the Buddha, strenuously denies this obvious truth and makes inplausible suggestions as to the meaning of this line (see, Minor Reading and Illustrator, p.286-7). This is not the only case where the classical commentators try to defend  an `orthodox' Therav\=ada position and so distort the straightforward meaning of the Pali texts. The words of Pali commentators should be carefully examined.
   Why does a verse upon anger/hatred/resentment follow next? The sutta has already emphasized that Mett\=a should be extended to all kinds of beings, classified in less poetic terms elsewhere as `the footless, two-footed, four-footed and many-footed; those with perception, those with no perception, and those with neither perception nor non-perception' (A.Fours.34). But for effective practice these must not remain abstract catagories towards which one plays at extending mett\=a. Particular beings, especially `difficult' humans, or animals which evoke fear have to be involved. Real mett\=a then arises naturally through the understanding of one's fears. This verse is here so that the practitioner does not fool him or herself: `Now my practice of limitless love, unconditional love, flows to all being!' Better look at how one feels with those one fears or does not like! In mett\=a-practice beings come first, directions and direction-less practice must always follow.  This order prevents self-deception.
   There follows the famous simile of a mother's love for her child and how one's mind becoming limitless with mett\=a should resemble this. For most of us, loving all beings in that way is not going to be easy. `Boundless love” becomes possible through the experience of jh\=ana and while a few people will have spontaneous experience of this relaxed but concentrated state of meditation, most require to be diligent with regular meditation practice. Jh\=ana has no good English translation and for that reason is left untranslated. Meditation, concentration or contemplation are all Latin-based words which do not have the clear meaning of the P\=ali word jh\=ana. This word does not occur in the sutta but is implied by such expressions as `boundless', `consciousness sublime', upwards and downwards and across the world'. Other religious traditions outside the Buddha's teaching have also what is known as `saints' and mystics who experience jh\=ana. 
   The last but one verse indicates the practice of mindfulness, how one should not drift and attach to rapture of jh\=ana but rather cultivate a mental state near to wisdom (prana/prajna). This union of calm and clarity characterises the four Devine Abidings, which are frequently referred to in the suttas. The words `they say' refer in general to wise meditative persons, not specially to Buddhist teachers.
   The last verse however restricts these people to those who are `quite free from any view' that is, they are free from mere or blind belief which cannot be verified by practice with an unclouded mind. They are free even from the Buddhist assumptions which everyone will have when they start regular and sustained meditation practice. Such people are not keen to label themselves `Therav\=ada', `Vipassan\=a', Mahay\=ana', Vajray\=ana', `Zen' for these are the playthings of those who do not Know. The truly liberated are not imprisoned by such limitations though they may use such words in the instruction of others. The verse reminds us that to find this liberation we need to act in a way that neither harms others or ourselves – `virtuous' (sīlav\=a), have access to insight-wisdom (dassana), and have more moderate sense-desires and let them go, the famous or infamous k\=ama which limits the mind's freedom, so that we arrive at the state of not being ever again being driven into birth.
   No methods of meditation are offered in the P\=ali suttas. For these, an ancient times and still in present, one consulted one's teacher. Teachers in the Buddha's time would have had direct Knowledge of the Dharma and so needed to learn no methods. Teachers in later times,  if they have no direct knowledge would consult the Path of Purification, that the compendium of Therav\=ada Buddhist knowledge complied by Buddhaghosa. This is still highly revered, both teacher and book, in Therav\=ada lands. Some more recent teachers out of their own experience have taught methods that differ somewhat from this tradition.
   If one wishes to consult the traditional P\=ali sources explaining this sutta, they are available  in the translation of the Paramatthajotik\=a (The Illustrator of Ultimate Meaning, by translator Bhikkhu N\=anamoli, published by the P\=ali Text Society. The P\=ali text itself is also currently in print).
   The present translation is based, though with many corrections, upon that of David Maurice, in the long out-of-print anthology, `The Lion's Roar'.

\section{A few Notes}

% % %Fix quotation marks   
`Yakkha': who or what are they? They appeared, in the Buddha's day to be believed semi-spiritual being who were powerful and rather easily angered, living in wild places. Possibly they were members of aboriginal tribes who had proficiency in magical matter or were believed to possess these. They were certainly feared.
   
The first of the v.153 mentions `the lunar fifteenth day' which requires a little explanation. In the Buddha's days the calendar was counted by the moon's action rather than the sun. `Months' of about 28 days, thirteen of such lunar months approximating to a solar year at 364 days needed to be augmented to complete the sun year. New Moons and Full Moons were important for these days measured the uposatha days. The uposatha day was (and is) the gathering of disciples who reconfirmed their dharma-practice twice every year on these two days by celebrating the chanting of the P\=atimokkha rules.
   
Second verse: Hemavata asks whether the Teacher Gotama's mind is well- disposed towards all beings – he is in fact asking about mett\=a/loving kindness. While in the second two lines his enquiry regards wisdom – pann\=a. He seems to be well-informed since these words cover both necessary approaches for awakening. `Within his power, are his thought towards the wished, the unwished too'. Though it is possible to talk about `thought within one's own power', this is only a way of speaking fit for the awakened. For who is this assumed person who possesses thoughts and can label them `mine'? It is not that anything is owned, not even thoughts are owned by the Awakened!
   
`Among dharmas Buddha (is) Eyed': Dharmas are the qualities, virtuous and otherwise which manifest in mind, flit though it in a constant stream always changing. Many of these mind-patterns are disregarded, neglected or repressed by ordinary people but their understanding of themselves sharpens as they begin to practice mindfulness. With the maturity of mindfulness practice they can be called `Eyed', those with insight, with deep understanding of the way things really are. More upon Eyes will be found at A. Threes. 29 where the eyeless, the one-eyed and the two-eyed are explained.
   
`Are his inflows now extinct?' Inflows (\=asava) are usually listed as the inflow of sensual desire, the inflow of being/existence, that of ignorance, to which is occasionally added, the inflow of views. These are the deepest level of confused mind and are frequently explained in the Suttas.
   
S\=atagira rightly remarks: `for him all inflows are extinct, so he will not again become'. Notice that `extinction' applies to the inflows which are conditioned and are therefore impermanent. The Buddha though will not be driven into becoming this or that sort of being again. This does not mean that a Buddha will disappear into a mysterious Nirv\=ana which is neither existence or non-existence. His condition is neither and beyond either the extremes of nihilism and eternalism.
   
Hemavata: three verses all opening with `Accomplished is the Sage's mond' have interesting final lines:
`rightly him you praise'(163A), `rightly you rejoice' (163B) and`it's good that we see Gotama' (164)
   
He's praised for his actions and speech which cause no suffering but bring benefit – they are never harmful. The true Knowledge that he is possessed of is usually described as the threefold knowledge (tevijj\=a) consisting of the knowledge of past lives, the knowledge of the future results of karmas made, and should we not praise a person like this with such virtues, though recommending him to others, or chanting his praises in pujas, if we did not what sort of practitioners would we be?
   
`Rightly you rejoice' – why would one do that? `Rejoice' here means to rejoice in the knowledge – all the good things – of the Teacher. Not to do so might mean that one was too proud to acknowledge these virtues of the Teacher. `Anumodan\=a', to rejoice in another's merits is to make very good karma indeed, while not to do so points to a narrow egocentric mind.
   
`It's good if we see Gotama': `seeing' a Teacher is a traditional Dharma practice in India. `Seeing' a Teacher may be only glimpsing him/her with the expectation that one will receive a blessing in which case it is called dharshan (dassana in P\=ali, a verb related to the pass\=ama, we see, which is found in the Sn text). More deeply committed pupils willwant to have closer connection to their teacher: to see more than a brief glimpse, to understand how to practice, or even to See or realise for themselves.
   
Hemavata, obviously a very intelligent yakkha, eventually asks the Buddha a subtle question: `What co-arises with the world?' etc. This line and others that he speaks shows his awareness, for instance, that he knows that the world's arising, in whatever way one thinks of `world', is according to Dharma, co-production – produced from many causes. The second question poses difficulties which most translations have not solved while mine is just a shot in the dark. The third is straightforward while the fourth question treats the results of the third. The verse with its four questions is partly a least a riddle.
   
On this occasion, the Buddha in answers riddle with riddle and does not really explain his reply to Hemavata's questions. All he seems to have done is add the number `six' – to each line in the verse. It would be surprising if these two Yakkhas had obtained the fullest satisfaction with this `explanatory' verse, for the Buddha explained nothing. The Sn. Comy has tried to account for this strange situation and `explains' what the various sixes are. What follows are my speculations about the meanings.
   
Verses 168-169: Buddhist understanding of creation is not that there is a creating force beyond the world which somehow brings forth in the world. Creation comes about as all necessary factors arise for a world, those factors must `arise together', or as I have translated, `co-arise'. So much for distant material creation. If `world' is understood as the five senses plus the mind as the sixth (vs.171.).
   
    
   
    
 \chapter{\=Alavaka Sutta -- With the Yakkha \=Alavaka}
    
Thus have l heard:
At one time the Lord dwelt at \=Alavi in the haunt of the yakkha \=Alavaka. Then the latter went to the Lord's dwelling and spoke to him as follows: `Monk, come out!' `Very well, friend' said the Buddha (and came out). `Monk, go in!'
   `Very well, friend' said the Buddha and entered his dwelling. he repeated these demands another twice but on the fourth demand the Buddha said: 
   
`I shall not come out to you, friend, do what you will.' 
   
`Monk, I shall ask you a question and if you cannot answer it I shall either overthrow your mind, split your heart, or seizing you by the feet, throw you to the other side of the Ganges river.'
   
`I do not see, friend, anyone in the world with its devas, maras and brahmas, in this generation with its monks and brahmins, princes and men who can either overthrow my mind, or split my heart, or seize me by the feet and throw me to the other side of the Ganges river. However, friend, ask what you will.'

\section{Comments upon the Vijaya Sutta}

Apart from attachments to one's `own' mind, the next strongest bond is to the body, one's `own' of course but by extension to other bodies. This is a sutta ﬁt for two sorts of persons: one who wishes to practise renunciation as a member of a monastic sangha; or second, one whose sexual desires are very powerful. The teachings of this sutta are not so appropriate to  those living a non-monastic life, or to people whose desires are of less power. Still, everyone will beneﬁt from an occasional perusal of this sutta's teachings, a reminder of the nature of this body which we identify as `ours'. The ﬁrst verse conveys the way the body really is, its movements just movements, neither reﬁned nor gross. The movements are not `mine' or `yours' they are merely the body's. Leaving aside the embellishments, so much advertised and flaunted in our times, as well as the repulsive aspects of bodies —-   they are all just as they are, neither good nor bad, neither beautiful or ugly, neither attractive nor repulsive. Of course, this is advice to those who meditate and who wish to have some success with their practice. Others may not understand. Verse two starts to specify medicine for minds too much swayed by lust. This Dharma-medicine will seem to the attached as rather bitter in ﬂavour. The body, one's own and others', not seen as it really is, is sketched in outline, bones, sinews, membranes, ﬂesh, and skin and reminds one of the famous ﬁve: hair of the head, hair of the body, nails, teeth and skin. These ﬁve are ﬁrst in the list of 32 parts recommended for meditation and summarize precisely what we seen when looking at another person (See, Khp.) This, a list of the Khuddaka-patha has a commentary upon the 32 parts. A few more choice ingredients of the body appear in verse 195. These are parts and liquids that in general people are not happy to see, especially when they are their own. But where should we be without bones and sinews, or how to exist lacking guts and belly? We only look on the outside of our own or others' bodies and take for granted that other more or less unpleasant hidden parts exist. Rather a one--sided view of the body!

Continuing the list with emphasis on liquids, as found also in the 32 parts: `bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, (skin) grease, spit snot oil—-for—-the--joints, piss. The whole list may be a pre-Buddhist medical list of the body's contents though surprisingly it ignores semen. The nine streams or impurity are explained in the next verse. 

These are what flows from: 2 eyes, 2 ears, 2 nostrils, l mouth, plus the body. This adds up to eight. `Mouth' could be counted twice as two sorts of impurity are mentioned: vomit and phlegm. Or `sweat' and `dirt' may count as   two from the body. The Pali Commentary does not clarify this. ln other texts the body's openings are counted as 2 eyes, 2 ears, 2 nostrils, mouth, urinary exit  plus anus, making nine. Here, the last two are absent, rather strange if `impurities' are being counted.

While it may seem to us that many people have hollow heads without any `bundled brains', the real function of the brain was not appreciated in ancient India though many other parts of the body had functions known to Ayurveda (medical) treatises. 

The following verse turns attention from internal body bits to the body's death. `Cast away in the charnel ground' refers to a common way of recycling bodies in the Buddha's days. A portion of forest was declared both a crematory and a disposal point for bodies. Cremating bodies cost more — trees to be felled or wood to be scavenged, while taking the body to this secluded and forested area and leaving it there after due rites was more economical. It is unlikely that   the latter will recommend itself to local councils though ours are the days of recycling. Perhaps we are more sentimentally attached to the corpse of a dear   one, than were Indians of those times, This seems to have been the case as `kin care for it not' and of course they do not care for the corpse because there was no refrigeration then, so that its `bloated and livid blue' and most importantly what the text takes for granted: its stench, is unbearable.

However, it was still attractive to some creatures who were very happy to recycle it, as the next verse recalls. Sus\`ana, the charnel-ground, was not a place for the faint-hearted. Those who delivered bodies to be dealt with by ﬁre, or by decay or by creatures, did not hang about there. Only some yogis/yoginis and  occasional bhikkhus/bhikkhunis would be bold enough to stay there, especially through the night. Most people would have found, and would ﬁnd today, such serious reminders of impermanence too stark but serious Dharma practitioners lived there without fear.

This tradition from pre-Buddhist times, through the Buddha's lifetime about 2500 years ago, lasted in lndia at least another i500 years. We know this  through the gory descriptions of such `boneyards' found in Buddhist Tantras. These documents, some earlier around 500 CE and some as late as 1000 CE,  paint pictures of some fairly wild characters dwelling in these places. They were at home not only with the ghastly sights but also with various spiritual protectors as well as demonic forces that dwelt there. There is no doubt that these practitioners, for instance some of the famous 84 Siddhas, lived for long periods there to their great beneﬁt.

A `bhikkhu' praised in the next verse, should be understood to include any devoted practitioner. Of course, there are bhikkhus and bhikkhus, a few wise but many without much practice and certainly no insight. It is sad to say this but the mere fact of a man (or woman) having shaven head and robes on does not guarantee spiritual awareness. There are so many people who assume otherwise and then lose all faith when their robed guru turns out to have worse than clay feet. 

Knowing the body `as it really is' means that most of us do not have thorough knowledge of it. somehow we muddle on with a decaying body and only wake up a little when our bodies are in their last drawn~out struggles. lt is better to see how it really is long before that time.

Verse 203 has been expanded in this translation. Literally the ﬁrst two
lines read:

\begin{MyDescription}[]{}
   As this (is) so (was) that,\\
   as that (is), so (will be) this,
\end{MyDescription}

Though the Pali meaning is clear, such brevity conveys little in English. Those sus\`ana were used for such reﬂection and helped to discard desires whether for   one's own or others' bodies. 

Notice that the emphasis in this sutta is upon using bodily bits and corpses  to see things as they truly are. There is no trace here of stirring up hatred for the body, which is uncharacteristic of early Buddhist works. Other religious traditions and to some extent later Buddhist works do emphasize hatred against the body. This may be seen in some Pali Commentaries as well as in some Mahayana works. See for instance Chapter 8 of the Bodhicaryavatara.

\section{Un muni, mona and munitti and other matters}
There are a group related words in Pali with meanings that cannot be covered by a similar linguistic group in English. This can be seen from the table below:
\newline
\newline
\begin{tabular}{|p{4cm}|p{4cm}|p{4cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{mum}&\textbf{Mona}&\textbf{munati}\\ \hline
(noun), trans. sage, or perhaps a word not be translated& (noun), trans. silence, solitary practice.& (verb) to be wise, specifically because of solitary life \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\newline
\newline
Originally, the person referred [to] was not a bhikkhu in the Buddhist sense though the later Pali Commentaries maintain that muni=solitary bhikkhu. Evidence in the suttas suggests that some disciples of the Buddha lived as solitaries in the forest or in caves without the burden of the monk's rules, the Vinaya. This tradition of receiving instructions from a teacher and then retiring for practice in solitude pre--dates the Buddha. What we now call Hinduism had, and still has, many holy men who practised among other things, silence to varying degrees. The most extreme would never speak and lived in solitary places so that they never had any cause to do so. There is, in Buddhist records an example of bhikkhus who decide that during their ﬁrst Rains Retreat they will refrain from talking. At the end of this three or four months they return the [to?] visit the Buddha who asked them how their retreat has been been. They tell him of their silence. He rebukes them that they should practise silence like animals do. Human beings should communicate and not act as they do for lack of speech. to   this day, what they wanted to practise was and is called `mauna'. The verb `munati' is not so common in Pali but its existence demonstrates a further meaning: wisdom derived from long periods of contemplation without much conversation. 
The last verse perhaps is not entirely true of our own times when educated practitioners may be found among the laity. Many years ago in my work on Vinaya (`Moss on the Stones, unpublished), I had made another and more elegant, translation of this verse:
\begin{MyDescription}[\arabic{stanza}]{}

never rivals ﬂight of swans,\\
so householders are no match\\
for forest sage who meditates.
\stepcounter{stanza}
\end{MyDescription}

Finally, though it is not found in Pali Buddhist tradition, there is the well--known mantra for the praise of our great teacher when he is called Shakyamuni:

\section{The Meaning of \=amagandha and other considerations}
This short sutta provides us with a number of puzzles beginning with its title. It is critical how this compound of \=ama and gandha is translated. '\=ama' originally meant `raw' or `uncooked' while `gandha' is a general word for `smell' which can be qualiﬁed by adding the preﬁxes `su' — good, or `du' — bad. One might assume from this that the meaning of these two words in a compound should be `the smell of uncooked food`. ln fact, they came to mean `the smell of raw (meat)'. By extension, and considering the lack of refrigeration in tropical India in ancient times and the speed with which raw meat goes off, it implied `the stench of carrion'.
Past translators have struggled with this complex word:\\
\newline
such are ﬂesh-savours and not eating meat' (E.M Hare),\\
\newline
this is a stench. Not the eating of meat' (Saddhatissa),\\
\newline
this is tainted fare, not the eating of ﬂesh' (Norman/Homer),\\
\newline
the foul smell of carrion, not the eating of ﬂesh' (jayawickrama).\\
\newline
   
These are four examples of the refrain in vv.242-248 according to the authors above. However it is translated it must apply both to eating meat and the bad `smell' of evil karma. This is because the Buddha, in these verses lists evil conduct as `carrion-stench' of great import, as opposed to `the eating of meat' which is a much lesser matter. Brahmins particularly proclaimed their purity because they adhered to a vegetarian diet while looking down upon some lower casts who were meat-eaters. To this day while travelling in India one may be asked by a high-caste person if one is a vegetarian. A positive answer to this question will gain one several points of esteem in that brahmin's mind. This is based upon a common teaching in Hinduism on what could be called the doctrine of `purity through eating'. If only purity was so easy! The Buddha's verses in this sutta point out  what is truly impure. However, this should not be taken as a rejection of vegetarian food or a denial of its benefits, specially that it involves no slaughter of animals.\\

Earlier Buddhist views about this are inﬂuenced by the example of the Buddhist monk or nun's behaviour going upon alms round with their bowls, accepting to eat this day whatever food they are offered and then eating it without the discrimination `this is good, this is not'. Such an attitude is reasonable for monks and nuns who have no money and so cannot choose what they will have. But laypeople who do have money are able to choose and may give food which has not involved killing. And many monks these days do have money. Later Buddhists, as monastic institutions grew in size, perceived that it would be better to advise their donors to adhere to vegetarian diets and to give monastics, from a concern for the animals killed, vegetarian food. Even with this consideration, the main emphasis for all Buddhists is upon the mind, with less stress upon food. That this is correct may be seen from the presence of occasional extremist vegetarians whose concern for a particular diet based upon some `view' of food is in their eyes the most important feature of practising Dharma, while to others their doctrines are a neurotic obsession.\\
  
At a few places in the suttas, including this sutta, it seems that the Buddha when he was offered food containing meat, ate it. Possibly, since references to this are few, this was a rare event. lf challenged the Buddha would give most importance to the state of mind and very much less to the content of food. And it is worth our consideration, though this cannot be an excuse for indulgence, that even the purest of vegans will not be able to eat anything without the destruction of some living beings: to live is dependent upon eating; to eat is to destroy. This is sams\=ara — the wandering through birth and death and has its dark side though compassion may limit this.\\

Another odd matter about this sutta is its participants — only two of them, once a brahmin, lissa, and the other a Buddha called Kassapa. At least this is what the Comy says. ln the sutta itself the name "ﬁssa' does not occur while the expounder of the Dharma is just called 'Kassapa'. Now, both these names are very common in the suttas where dozens of Tissas occur and many Kassapas as well. While the interlocutor may well have been a brahmin called Tissa, that the Kassapa here should have been a Buddha is more doubtful. A Buddha by that name in D.l4 and if we take that reference literally, lived very long ago. To claim, as Comy does, that that remote Buddha and that the Kassapa of this sutta are the same makes for difficulties. The most obvious of these is found in Pali Comys that claim that a new Buddha cannot arise until all marks of a previous Buddha — teachings, robes, stupas, images and so on — have disappeared. This may be called a rather `late' doctrine and in our eyes these days a rather unimportant one. Still if the Comy is examined the question will arise: How did this supposed sutta from the mouth of the Buddha Kassapa survive the intervening aeons to appear eventually in the text of Sn? As this is such a doubtful matter and one which cannot be resolved we are faced with either its acceptance as a wonderful survival from another Budda's era, or more likely the verses of a disciple of `our' Buddha, one of a number of disciples called Kassapa. This however, will not explain references to a Buddha in the last two verses.\\
 
Two other minor matters may be mentioned here. Verse 249 gives poetically a list of wrong practises, wrong because by themselves they will not lead to liberation though some of them may have value. These austerities, mild or severe, were not praised by the Buddha s he was surrounded, outside his own disciples, by extremist doctrines and practitioners who held the wrong view that liberation was to be attained by dukkha. A similar but shorter verse is found at Dhp. 141:

\begin{MyDescription}[]{}
Neither going naked, nor matted hair, nor filth,\\
nor fasting, nor sleeping on the earth,\\
no penance on the heels, nor sweatiness, nor grime,\\
can purify a mortal still overcome by doubt.
\end{MyDescription}

Whoever the Kassapa was he was faced by a Tissa who was either stupid or prejudiced since the teacher had to repeat his teaching again and again according to verse 251!\\

A further use of this word in Sn. at verse 717 is in the negative form `nir\=amagandha' where it is translated `carrion-stench' but seems to refer not to food but to sex.

\section{Notes on the Hiri Sutta}
First, a few words upon the translation of `hiri' into English. Most translators have used `shame' but there are many objections to this: `Hiri' as a quality in the Suttas and Abhidhamma is wholesome, a good quality. lt features notably in the Suttas at A. Twos. I 8-9 where hiri and its companion \textit{ottappa} are translated as `shame and fear of blame' (Gradual Sayings, P.T.S) though the translator in a footnote has `conscientiousness' as an altemative for the ﬁrst of these. This ungainly word is preferable to `shame', as the latter in English could not be called totally wholesome being associated, as it is, with guilt. Hiri and its companion by contrast are called bright (sukka) dharmas and praised as world's protectors. They protect the world from degenelation to greed, hatred and delusion. Protecting the world has two meanings — protecting the mind of the potential doer, and protecting others from the sufferings brought about by unrestrained evil.\\

Ny\=anamoli in his translations suggests `shamefulness' for hiri but this does not cover subsidiary meanings such as `shyness' or `bashfulness' which cannot be described as wholesome qualities. `Conscience' will be appropriate in some places and `modesty' in others, sometimes even `decency'. It is difﬁcult to ﬁnd an English word to cover all this. Ottappa is best translated as `fear of consequences' and with hiri acts as a brake for some peoples' unwholesome drives.\\

The verses of this sutta are a rag-bag — bits and pieces from here and there somehow cobbled together with little attention to coherence. Though called the Hiri Sutta it is not mostly about conscience, decency shame etc., but rather concerns the qualities of a good friend. The Pali Commentary tries to make sense of these verses by giving them an invented occasion when a brahmin asked of the Buddha four questions. However this seems an artificial `explanation' and has led to some strange translations (For the four questions see Saddhatissas translation).\\

The ﬁrst three verses are straightforward but the fourth has had many and varied translations. l have not followed the Pali Commentary in interpreting this sutta. The fourth verse describes a person who has fully practised the Dharma and is ﬁt to be a teacher of others, a bodhisattva perhaps since he/she bears the human by removing it from others who suffer. A true friend indeed! Verse 5, a favourite of mine, is from the Dhammapada (205) while verse 2 appears also at Jataka III. 193: Va\=o\=o\=aroha J\=ataka, No. 361.\\

\section{Mangala: false mangalas and Dharma-mangalas}
in the Buddha's days, as in our own, people adhered to the superstitious ideas of what is lucky/unlucky, auspicious and its opposite and even `religious' omens of fortune and misfortune. Such events, happenings and bodily marks have of course varied through the ages but the ideas and superstitions connected with it remain a part of many peoples' lives. India being a vast country with many languages and cultural differences, then as now, had differing traditions about what was lucky but no certainty could be reached about the underlying reasons why `a' was lucky and `b' unlucky. Tradition could not agree about it. This is what the Mangala Sutta's ﬁrst verse is about. Devas and humans decided to ask the Buddha about this matter.\\

Before we read his list of 37 `supreme good omens', we should be clear about the usual understanding of omen. An example that I encountered years ago in Thailand will illustrate the tangled and confused nature of omens generally.\\

ln Thailand, where bhikkhus usually go out to collect their food with their bowls in the early morning, the sight of a monk or several of them, as soon as the house or shop door is opened, is reckoned to be very auspicious. This auspiciousness' does not take account of whether the monk or monks are ennobled by their Dharma practice, or whether they are guys using the robes to get an easy livelihood. This `omen' of the sight of early morning monks of whatever kind, is reckoned `good'.\\

Opposed to this illogic is the idea held by Chinese of whom there are many in Bangkok and other Thai cities. lf they behold a monk first thing in the morning, this is reckoned in their tradition as inauspicious, not a good day for the making of money. Why? Though it is hard to believe, the argument goes thus: Monks own nothing (at least they are not supposed to own much) and they teach a doctrine of nothing (a confused reference to what is called `emptiness or voidness' in English), so they are ill—omened for businessmen! Here are two cultures with quite opposed ideas upon a supposed omen! ls one more true than the other? No, both are superstitious because the reason behind these `omens' is not based upon cause and effect. The causes (seeing monks) have no real relation to the supposed effects of either auspicious (Thai idea) or inauspicious Chinese).\\

In some cultures which are supposed to be scientifically `advanced' still many may be found who adhere without thought to ancient superstitions about what is good, lucky, or an omen. The Buddha's standard of auspiciousness transcends these confused ideas and offers a clear summary of what is truly beneﬁcial for everyone irrespective of race, language, culture and religion.\\

The sutta, which is straightforward, does not need a detailed commentary, though if one is required, the classical Pali Commentary upon this Sutta is translated in “Minor Readings and illustrator” published by the Pali Text Society. The translaﬁon of this book and of the sutta quoted here is by Ven. Nanamoli Thera, who tirelessly devoted his life to rendering many Pali texts into English, some of them quite abstruse. In his honour, and with the permission of the PTS, I quote his translation here with one or two minor changes.\\

One note upon the line: `Though one is touched by Worldly Dharmas' may be useful. What are the worldly dharmas that one may be touched by? This refers to the famous eight lokadhamm\=a found principally in A.Egiths, 5,6 and in my old translation made in Wat Bovoranives, Bangkok. The verses of this sutta read as follows:

\begin{MyDescription}[(A. Eights. 6)]{}
Gain and loss together with honour and dishonour,\\
blame and praise, happiness, dissatisfaction\footnote{`dissatisfaction' = dukkha} too,\\
these, the impermanent conditions of mankind\\
never perpetual, perturbate are they:\\
these, the heedful one with wisdom well-endowed\\
carefully discerns as conditions perturbate.\\
Desirable conditions do not agitate the mind,\\
nor conditions undesired and can make resentment rise,\\
compliance, opposition too, are for that one no more,\\
not smouldering are they, to non-existence gone;\\
and then having Known that Stainless, Grieﬂess State,\\
rightly one Knows becomings' Other Shore.\\
\end{MyDescription}

\begin{MyDescription}[(A. Eights. 6)]{}
\end{MyDescription}  

\chapter{S\=aciloma Sutta\\ To the Yakkha S\=aciloma}

Thus have I heard:\\
\newline

At one time the Radiant One was dwelling in Gaya at the Stone Couch in the place of the Yakkha S\=aciloma. At that time the yakkhas Khara and S\=aciloma paused nearby and the former said: `That is a monk'. `He's not a monk, he's justa `mere-monk' but wait until I ﬁnd out whether he's a monk or a `mere-monk''. Then the yakkha S\=aciloma approached the Radiant One and pressed his body against him, at which the Radiant One drew back. The yakkha then said to him, `Are you afraid of me, monk?' `Friend, l am not afraid of your but your touch is evil.' `Monk, l shall ask you a question and if you do not reply to me l shall overturn your mind, split your heart and grasping you by the feet fling you to the other side of the Ganges'. `Friend, I do not see anyone indeed who in this world with its devas, maras and brahma-gods, together with its people -— monks and brahmins, rulers and ordinary persons, who could overturn my mind, split my heart and grasping me by the feet ﬂing me to the other side of the Ganges. Still, friend, you can ask whatever you wish,'\\

Then the yakkha Saciloma addressed the Radiant One with this verse.

\begin{MyDescription}[\arabic{stanza}]{Saciloma:}
From whence the causes of both lust and hate,\\
from what are likes, dislikes and terror born,\\
what origin's there for thoughts in mind,\\

\section{Remarks upon S\=aciloma Sutta}
Yakkhas are perhaps demonized wild non-ariyan inhabitants who lived in forests and had few possessions but some reputation for magical matters. Saciloma, a name meaning `needle-hair' was possibly a very hairy male though one may doubt that his hair was needle-like. The Buddha's remark that he was not afraid of him but that his touch was `evil' may mean that this yakkha was unwashed and malodorous. Though he seems to have been uncouth yet the question he asked is not that of an ignorant person.\\

The question-verse in its first three lines has the P\=ali interrogative `kuto' — whence, from where, from what. `Kutonidana' in the ﬁrst line means `from whence the causes', `kutoia' in the second translates `bom from what', while the third line has `kuto summutthaya' is `from what origin'. This question is framed very much in Buddhist teaching: the enquiry into causality.\\
 
The simile in the last line raises a number of questions, the first of them being, what is it that boys do to a crow? We are not told in the sutta about this and most translators have resorted to the P\=ali Comy. There it is explained that boys catch a crow, tie string to its legs and let it go as far as the string permits when they jerk it and so crash the crow. Sounds like boys generally have not changed much! This may be true, or perhaps the Comy has based its tale on later behaviour of boys! As the line reads it is literally `as boys a crow...' The space here is for translation of the verb `ossaiiati' which PTSD says means `to let loose, let go, send off, giveup, dismiss, release', while ADOP adds `lets go, releases, throws, abandons'. The P\=ali Comy glosses this verb with `khipati', to throw.\\
  
Translators so far have rendered the simile: `drag down as boys will drag a crow' (E.M Hare), '(harass) as boys do a crow' (Saddhatissa), `as young boys toss up a (captive) crow' (K.R. Norman), `like (tethered) crow pulled by boys captors) earthward' (Mrs Rhys Davids in Kindred Saﬁngs, Samyutta Nikaya, Vol. I), and `(toss one around) as boys toss up a crow' (Bhikkhu Bodhi in The Connected Discourses of the Buddha, Samyutta Nilraya). While the  ossaiiati will support such translations as `drag', `toss up', `pull', etc, it cannot stretch to harass': `Harass' and even `torture' are what the boys are undoubtedly doing to the crow, an interpretation rather than a translation. As `bhipati = to throw' is a Comy. gloss this gives more latitude.\\

 The simile of the boys and the crow is interesting and unusual. The Comy explains that the boys represent the thoughts, while the crow is due mind which is either harassed or released. No doubt the P\=ali Comy identifies the boys as unwholesome states of mind and this is fitting in the first verse but even if the same meaning is given to the simile in the second verse, it will not ﬁt. Suppose that one chooses `toss around' as the translation for `ossaiiati' in both verses this is only appropriate for the verse, not for the Buddha's reply. All translators without exception, in following the Comy, repeat the same rendering of the simile in both verses. But now, supposing that the Buddha has played with the multiple meanings of vb. `ossajiati' so that a different meaning in the second verse is appropriate in translation?\\
 
  To appreciate that this might be so, we have to consider the meanings of ito' which replaces `kuto' in the second verse. ln this verse `ito' appears three times and is rendered `here' `now' and `present'. The Buddha in this verse has emphasized that `causes', `birth' and `origin' are not so much a matter of the past, especially of such beliefs as in past lives, as the first verse suggests, but concern the present. This emphasis on the present ties in with such teachings as:
 
 \begin{MyDescription}[]{}
    One should not trace back the past\\
   or on the future build one's hopes,\\
   the past is just the left-behind,\\
   the future is the yet-unreached;\\
   rather with insight one should see\\
   each dharma as it arises now...
\end{MyDescription}

\begin{MyDescription}[M. 131 Bhaddekaratta Sutta).]{}
\end{MyDescription}
And of course with the practice of mindfulness.\\

As the second verse deals with causality in the present moment which would lead to Awakening in the present, and as the vb ossaijati can mean `release, let go, loose', it seems appropriate to translate the line as: `as boys release a captive) crow'.\\

This pair of P\=ali verses could -be corrupt, as traditions other than the P\=ali texts vary widely. The sutta is repeated in S. One.X. 10.3 and readers should consult portions of the Comy. translated in \textit{Connected Discourses of the Buddha} of the Buddha, Vol.l, for further information.

\section{Notes on the Dhammacariya Sutta}
This sutta is unusual in that it contains no indication of who is teaching though one may assume that it is the Buddha. Of course, the Comy. offers an occasion for its teaching and makes it plain that the Buddha is exhorting the bhikkhus. Though called `Dhammacariya' it could better be known as the Adhammacariya Sutta as most of the verses concern the wrong conduct of a bhikkhu.\\

The language of condemnation of wayward monks is here quite strong and is directed at those who have major failings rather than peccadilloes. Obviously, such monks were hard to reform and the verses in the middle part of this sutta advise monks to avoid such people. Perhaps they were considered irreformable and there is certainly no suggestion here of compassionate action towards them.\\

in one sense, just as all humans can be labelled `crazy' so we are all `shit-pits' to some degree. Only those ennobled by the Dharma are free of these taints. So then the language of some of these verses seems unnecessarily severe. Perhaps these stanzas were composed by a particularly self-righteous monk who felt himself far above the failing of his brethren. How they have to be attributed to the Buddha is unknown.
  
  
\chapter{Br\=ahbmanadhammika Sutta\\ How brahmins lived by the Dharma}

Thus have l heard:\\
\newline
At one time the Radiant One dwelt at S\=avatthi, in the Jeta Grove, An\=athapindika's park. Then many decrepit old Kosalan brahmins, aged, elderly, advanced in years, attained to old age, those indeed of palatial abodes, went to the Radiant One and exchanged greeting with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was finished they sat down to one side. Sitting there these brahmins of palatial abodes said, `Master Gotama, are there now to be seen any brahmins who practise the Brahmin Dharma of the brahmins of old?' `No brahmins, there are no brahmins now to be seen who practise the Brahmin Dharma of the brahmins of old.' `It would be excellent if the good Gotama would speak to us upon the Dharma of the brahmins of old if it would not be too much trouble.' `Then brahmins,' listen well and bear in mind what l shall say'. `Indeed, venerable' said those brahmins of palatial abodes to the Radiant One.

\section{The Rich Old Brahmin's and the Buddha --}
\subsection{What happened?}
Imagine the scenario: the Buddha is seated in the grounds of the Jeta Grove outside the prosperous city of S\=avatthi (Sr\=avasti). A number of really old brahmins who are also rich come to call on the Buddha, no doubt in chariots and with servants and possibly pupils as well. That they are old is insisted upon the use in the text of no less than six adjectives to this effect, so we may picture them in the 70s, 80s or 90s even. That they are rich is described by only one word `mahasala', literally `of great halls' surrounded no doubt by great estates from which they derived much wealth. As was the custom among Indians, especially brahmins, in approaching a Teacher they ﬁrst exchanged greetings and no doubt their names with the Buddha and we are told that this included `courteous and amiable talk'. This was taken to be a polite and auspicious beginning to contact with a Teacher. Sitting to one side is also polite, in this way a visitor does not presume to occupy the space immediately opposite the Teacher. Then one of these rich old brahmins speaking on behalf of the others, asked his astonishing Question.\\

At this point we may pause in our imagination of the scene and bring to the fore our examining faculties: Why did these old brahmins ask the Buddha a question which they must have known would receive a negative reply? They would know — perhaps partly from their own lives — that brahmins of their times conducted themselves far differently from the ideal brahmins of the past. And of course the Buddha denied that there were any brahmins in their times who lived according to the ancient brahmin Dharma. The old brahmins then asked him very politely, (`if it would not be too much trouble') to discourse upon this subject.\\

The puzzle posed by the sutta is why the brahmins asked this particular question. They would know the conditions of most brahmins in their society: a glimpse of this may be had from some verses of Sn. - 612-619. There we learn that so-called brahmins were farmers, craftsmen, merchants, servants, thieves, soldiers, priests and rajahs. But the Buddha's very high standards on what constituted a brahmin (620-647) went far beyond these worldly descriptions.\\

From their studies of the Vedas and auxiliary literature, they would know how brahmins were portrayed in the distant past, so why did they, according to this text, ask the Buddha about this. It could be that some of them were curious as to how the Buddha would reply for after all, he was not regarded by them as an `orthodox' brahminical teacher. Perhaps he would give a scathing account of brahmin behaviour which they could then argue with him. Or perhaps they wished an answer from a teacher they knew to be famous who would see this question in a different light. ln general though, the brahmins in the P\=ali suttas are portrayed as orthodox and conservative, having little interest in exploring others' teachings. There are notable exceptions, as with V\=settha and Bh\=aradv\=aja at Sn. 594-656, but most brahmins did not welcome other teachers examining and criticizing parts of the Brahmin Dharma. ln any case these brahmins did not ask a question which could go beyond their own tradition.\\

As an alternative to these speculation there is the possibility that the occasion' (nidana) for this discourse has nothing to with rich old brahmins asking an improbable question. Prose suttas have `occasions' describing when and where they were spoken by the Buddha and there are a few cases of this in Sn. ln the majority of the poetic suttas there is no occasion given in the Sn. text but the Sn. Comy. provides `occasions', some of which are more likely than others. Let us suppose that this `occasion' though included in the Sn. text is in fact a later addition to the verses and provides a story upon which may be build a strong Buddhist criticism of the brahmins. This supposition would dissolve away the story of old brahmins asking about their own Dharma.

\subsection{Brahmins, those then past and then present}

Sn. 284-298 verses concern how the ancient brahmins lived with their ideal conduct given in detail. Whether this is looking back upon a `golden age' of brahmins, or whether it agreed with the facts of history, is hard to tell, though it is common to all religious traditions that they begin with a flowering of true spirituality, to be followed over generations by decline. Verses 284-288 could almost apply to the lives of good bhikkhus who also are held in honour for their austere and compassionate practice and so receive gifts from their supporters. The next verse introduces a particularly brahminical practice, the long studentship of young celibate brahmins more less spent with their teachers. When this period of the Good Life was complete then brahmins married. Verse 301 throws light upon brahminical fears of `pollution', that is, of degradation from their caste, in this case caused by contact with menstrual blood. Hindu law books contain many examples of what leads to being outcasted, such as travelling overseas and partaking food not cooked by brahmin-caste people, and so on. By contrast, the Buddha emphasized pollution of the mind/emotions. However, verse 292 pictures a Good Life which would be an ornament to anyone whether in Buddhist monastic robes or within other religious traditions.\\

There follow two verses strongly advocating the celibate life in a way that could describe good bhikkhus too. From 295 onwards there are verses upon begging'. English does not have a very good word to translate `y\=acati' as understood by Buddhist teachings. A bhikkhu going on almsround must be silent, unless spoken to, and may not ask for food generally though allowances are made for sick monks. They collect in their bowls whatever people are happy to give to them. This dignified practice differs in many ways from the pictures conjured up by `begging'.\\

Verse 295 emphasizes that the original form of brahminical rites involved no bloodshed and is followed by two verses praising cattle, particularly cows, for their benefits to human society. No mention of course, is made of the so-called benefits of beef! Those brahmins then, and most of them today, were vegetarians and appreciated the many products that come from milk The results of this kindness to cattle and Dharma—practice generally are listed in 298.\\

But as is the way in this world, this happy state could not continue. The causes of brahminical decline are spelt out in the next few verses. Many of these factors would apply equally to Buddhist monastic degeneration. Just as those brahmins of old greedily stared at the wealth and luxury of the rajahs' courts and coveted what they saw, so many Buddhist monks these days want to enjoy the pleasures advertised in so many ways in `western' materialistic life.\\

Sn. 299-310 tells us precisely what those brahmins of ....[missing copy?].. The results of their karma was quite different. It is worth our reflection upon present times when so much adharma is practised and so many new diseases have arisen as dangers for us now. Could there be causes and effects — past human causes with painful results for us?\\

Weapons and killing are clearly stated (312) to be not the way of Dharma. But if we view our world now - through newspapers, radio, television and so on, what do we find every day — more and more violence. Some of it is dressed up as the lawful control of others who would bring even worse evils than we have presently. Powerful people, the present-day representatives of rajahs, speak upon this and are believed. `Well, they must know, mustn't they? They must know more than us!' So the blind follow the blind. What good can ever come from violence? This is not to recommend pacifism in its extreme forms for even the famous Buddhist king, Asoka, kept an army though he did not use it for offensive warfare after he became a Buddhist. But in general, violence begets violence while as the Dhammapada reminds us:

\begin{MyDescription}[]{}
Never here by enmity\\
are those with enmity allayed:\\
they are allayed by amity —\\
this is the Natural Law.
\end{MyDescription}

\begin{MyDescription}[(Dhp. 5)]{}
\end{MyDescription}

The sutta closes with two verses upon the destruction of traditional norms caused by the violence (in this case of the sacrifices) in their society. Even if the norms of that society (caste, discrimination and even persecution of low caste and outcaste people) does not recommend itself to our understanding of civilization, still it was an established code of behaviour. But the Buddha, whose essential teaching was (and is) karmic causation, pointed out and made clear that ritual sacrifices involving violence cannot possibly bring the good results of peace, good health and wealth. The (violent) causes do not agree with the desired peaceful results. lf we desire peace these days, this causation still applies: peace, happiness and spiritual growth can never be brought about by more and more dreadful weapons. Evil cannot be put down by more evil even when this is disguised by the powerful calls of nationalism, destruction of violent foes and our personal safety in future.

\section{Commentary on N\=av\=a Sutta} 
316. Whether the word 'vija??\=a" ****corrupt in original***  in the second line should be translated
   `knows' (in an intellectual sense) or `Knows' (through personal experience of
   Dharma's truth) one's Dharma-teacher, or many Dharma-teachers, should be greatly respected. They have opened one's eyes to the treasure of the Dharma, a gift excelling all other gifts. How they should be revered will vary with different cultures, even simple matters of prostration and anjali vary greatly, while some
   traditional marks of reverence may not be appropriate in `western' lands. Still, these things are not so important in comparison with heartfelt devotion and helpfulness. Those who truly revere their teachers never create trouble for them nor do they stir up strife among their disciples.\\
   
   317. `Practising the Dharma according with Dharma'
   (dhamm\=anudhammapatipatti) is obviously opposed to the egocentric method of `practising Dharma according to oneself'. With the former since it is Dharma-practice according with the teachings and principles of Dharma will advance experience of the Dharma, while with the latter the only result will be to lead away from Dharma and from one's teacher's instructions. The qualities of both the teacher and the pupil are both mentioned in this verse and it is obvious that pupils, with diligent practice, will become like their teacher in virtues and wisdom, eventually to become teachers themselves. Awakened teachers are sometimes referred to as those who are Such (T\=adi) that is, they have Known the Dharma as Such (or Thus) and not otherwise.\\
   
318. The dangers of not practising with a teacher who is Such but `following a foolish inferior fellow' are made plain in this verse. This description of an unworthy teacher and the disadvantages of being a student under him/her remind us of the verse (Sn. 259):

\begin{MyDescription}[]{}
Not consorting with the foolish,\\
rather with the wise consorting,\\
honouring the honourable....
\end{MyDescription}
   
The river of doubts is the experience of all unenlightened people. What do they doubt? They think that they know through blind devotion, intellectual knowledge or by following tradition, that really they Know but they only believe. `To believe' in fact, means `not to know' although one may be sure that one's belief is pure and correct, even the only doctrine which is true. But as belief in doctrines, including Buddhist ones, means that these have not been verified, there must, somewhere in the back of the mind, be doubt. The effort to believe, for instance in six improbable things before breakfast, is a rather unskilful way to cover up doubts. Doubts make for interior conﬂict, while beliefs can lead to exterior conflicts, even to bloodshed, persecution and wars. What are called religious beliefs in English are included under the Pali-Sanskrit word \textit{dithi/drsti,} ***Again incorrectly formatted in original*** literally `what has been seen', hence the English translation `view'. Right views are those which accord with Dharma whether in matters of moral conduct (sala), meditation (sam\=adhi) or in wisdom (pa\~n\~n\=a/praj\~n\=a). Dharma in this sense does not equate solely with `Buddhism'. It is not only Buddhists who are good, kind and generous people and who purify their minds! Wrong views may be minor matters of belief held in the mind but not disputed with others, or they may lead to violence, killings, sectarian wars and assassinations. ln general, holding views is a block to spiritual development. Holding Buddhist views of any kind means one has not seen the Dharma for oneself. Holding wrong views — and there is a great variety of them — is destructive of Dharma both within and without. Believing in
the Dharma may be a first step but it should not be long adhered to: clinging to the Dharma is just another kind of clinging (up\=ad\=ana) and this is certainly not Dharma. Dharma is to be veriﬁed, not views to be clung to.\\

319-320. The first of these verses presents a striking simile with a question at its conclusion. So, how can this person help others across these floods? The help that they try to give others — to get them across the floods of ignorance and craving — could not succeed because they have not yet experienced `knowledge profound' and so have not gone to the Further Shore themselves. Elsewhere too the Buddha speaks about the situation where one stuck on this shore of sams\=ara will be unable to extricate another person in the same plight: `This situation does not occur, Cunda, that one person sunk in a morass will be able to pull out another in the same plight' (M. 8) but one who is no longer stuck will be able to extract another. The Suttas also speak of three persons: one sunk in quicksands, another with one foot upon dry land and last the person with both feet on firm ground. Only the last one representing Buddhas and Awakened masters, is capable of pulling out others from the sams\=ara-morass. The middle person may be able to give some help as they have some personal experience of the awakening Dharma but the first person can hardly help others. Even if one has vowed, as in Mahayana traditions, to cross over all beings to Nirvana, still one must spend many years with good masters, learning and practising, before this can be even partly accomplished.\\


321. The strong boat is the Dharma. I have been fortunate to know a number of teachers who may have crossed over in the Dharma-vessel and taken many others across. These teachers' Dharma, both their instructions and their conduct, was wonderful, the words and actions of those gone beyond self. They had hundreds or thousands of pupils who revered them as models of the Dharma manifest in a living person. So of course, they could `take so many others across'. ln another sutta (M.22) the Buddha addressing bhikkhus says: `I shall show you how Dharma resembles a raft, being for the purpose of crossing over, not for the purpose of grasping. Suppose a traveller saw a great expanse of water, whose near shore was dangerous and fearful, whose further shore was safe and free from fear, but there was no ferry or bridge. Then after considering this, he collected grass, twigs, branches and leaves and bound them together in a raft, supported by which and making efforts with his hands and feet, he got safely across. Then when he had got across, he thought `This raft has been ve|y helpful to me, since by its means I got safely across; suppose that I hoist it on my head or load it on my shoulders and go wherever I want?' `No, Lord'. `What should he do with it then? lf when he got across, he thought, `This raft has been very helpful to me since by its means I got safely across; suppose I haul it up on dry land or set it adrift on the water and go where I want to go?' `That is how he should do what should be done with a raft. So I have shown you how the Dharma resembles a raft being for the purpose of crossing over, not for the purpose of grasping. When you Know Dharma resembling a raft, then even Dharma-teaching should be abandoned, what to speak of non-Dharma.' \\

The strong boat of Dharma can also be a vast vessel as in a M\=ah\=ayana sutra:

\begin{MyDescription}[]{}
What then again is the vessel leading to Bodhi?\\
Standing upon it one guides all beings to Nirvana.\\
Great is that vessel, immense, vast like the vastness of space\\
Those who travel upon it are carried to safety, delight and to ease.
\end{MyDescription}

So going across the ocean, lake, river, ﬂoods, has been taught in many ways by the Buddha according to the persons being addressed.\\
   
322. `Unshakeable Dharma' is only found in those who Know and See. They are not unshakeable because of obstinacy, or from attachment to views, dogmas or to their own ideas. No force of any kind can shake their Knowing and Seeing the truth of the Dharma. They are unshakeable, as the traditional P\=ali Comy remarks, by any or all of the eight Worldly Dhannas: Gain and loss, honour, dishonour, blame, praise, happiness, dissatisfaction (=dukkha). See also Comy on ll.4.\\

323. `Attained to the Bliss'. Sukha in this book is usually translated `happiness' but the sukha referred to here is that of realization of Dharma beyond all views.

\section{A Pithy Comment}
How long has one to live? Does an end, the old end of death, come today, tomorrow, a few weeks or months away? And here we are lying down for hours and hours. Do we sleep so long because life is so painful — too much dukkha. And when we reach bodily sufferings even the escape of sleep and drowsiness may be no longer available.\\

Get up and sit', means `do it while you can!' The obvious pleasures do not last for long and a time will come when even comforts no longer manifest. Life isn't nice for long. Even if you think of eighty years as long, think even that one hundred years passes soon and what will come after?\\

Our own Maras — our temptations and conflicts — strengthen the lazier we become. Mara is just a picturesque name for mental defilements. No Mara is `out there' to increase our dukkha — Maras are our own burdens. No need to be under Mara's control — or to be under the dominion of the daughters of Mara! So don't use Mara as an excuse of one's own weakness or failings.\\

Craving may be pleasant, evenly divinely pleasant for so are the devas attached to their delights and burdened by them. Divine attachments must seem superior to the joys of humanity but deva~happiness does not equate to liberation. In fact, tangling oneself with innumerable pleasures - where one can do this as a human — could lead as a result of that karma to a painful future. `Sending themselves to hell': no one else sends them there.\\

Dust' accumulates in the house from not cleaning it, similarly does dust in the mind which does however need moment by moment diligence to keep the dust away. Or perhaps a dart, rather than dust, will illustrate how painful is the accumulation of dirt. But it is al impermanent. Who has ever heard of permanent dirt? Though this is true one still has to open an eye and see what is to be seen. So,

\section{A Note upon Rahula Sutta}
This contains very ordinary Dharma advice for bhikkhus and the only unusual feature is found in verse 334. This raises the question of why the Buddha asks his son, R\=ahula, if he scorns him. Of course this happens often enough in household life, and could also occur in monastic communities. Having asked this, the Buddha continues with words praising himself. Somewhat odd! Perhaps, though this is a speculation, the first two verses are later additions for they ring rather hollow.

\chapter{Vangg\=asa Sutta\\ Vang\=asa's questions, Buddha's Answer}

Thus have l heard:\\
\newline
At one time the lord dwelt at \=al\=ava, at the Agg\=alava Shrine. Not long before the venerable Vang\=asa's preceptor, by name the elder Nigrodhakappa had become completely Cool at the Agg\=alava Shnrine. Then in Vang\=asa's mind, being at one and in solitude, arose this thought: Has my preceptor become completely Cool or has he not? Later in the day Vang\=asa left his solitude and went to the Lord and having drawn near him, paid his respects and sat to one side. While sitting there Vang\=asa said this to the Lord: While I was sitting in meditation this thought arose in my mind: Has my preceptor become completely cold or has he not? Vangasa then arose from his seat, placed his upper robe over one shoulder and, lotussing his hands respectfully, addressed the Lord with these verses.

\begin{MyDescription}[\arabic{stanza}]{Vangasa:}
We ask now the Teacher of wisdom supreme —\\
who's inseen the Dharma, who's cut off all doubts,\\

\chapter{Padh\=ana Sutta - The Striving of Gotama}

\begin{MyDescription}[]{The Bodhisattva:}
As I strove to subdue myself\\
beside the broad Neranjar\=a\\
absorbed unﬂinchingly to gain\\
the tme surcease of bondage here,\\
Namuc\=a came and spoke to me\\
with words all garbed in pity thus:
\end{MyDescription}

\begin{MyDescription}[]{M\=ara:}
`O you are thin and you are pale\\
and you are in death's presence too:\\
a thousand parts are pledged to death\\
but life still holds one part of you.\\
Live, sir! Life's the better way;\\
you may gain merit if you live,\\
come live the life of purity, pour\\
libations on the holy ﬁres\\
and thus a world of merit gain.\\
What can you do by struggling now?\\
The path of struggling too is rough\\
and difficult and hard to bear.'\\
Now M\=ara, as he spoke these line\\
drew near until he stood close by.
\end{MyDescription}

\begin{MyDescription}[]{The Bodhisattva:}
The Blessed One replied to him\\
as he stood thus: `O Evil One,\\
O Cousin of the Negligent,\\
you have come here for your own ends.\\
Now, merit I need not at all.\\
Let Mara talk of merit then\\
to those that stand in need of it.\\
For I have faith and energy,\\
and I have understanding, too.\\
So while I thus subdue myself\\
why do you speak to me of life?\\
There is this wind that blows, can dry\\
even the rivers' running streams;\\
so while I thus subdue myself,\\
why should it not dry up my blood?\\
And, as the blood dries up, then bile\\
and phlegm run dry, the wasting ﬂesh\\
becalms the mind: I shall have more\\
of mindfulness and wisdom too,\\
I shall have greater concentration.\\
For living thus I come to know\\
the limits to which feeling goes.\\
My mind looks not to sense-desires\\
then sees a being's purity.\\
Your squadron's first is sense-desires\\
your second's sexual discontent,\\
Hunger and Thirst compose the third,\\
and Craving is the fourth in rank,\\
the fifth is Sloth and Accidy,\\
while fear is called the sixth in line,\\
Sceptical doubt is seventh, the eighth\\
is Sliminess, Hardheartedness;\\
Gain with Honour, Praise besides,\\
and ill-won Notoriety,\\
Self-praise and Denigrating others —\\
These are your squadrons, Namuc\=a,\\
the Black One's fighting troops.\\
None but the brave will conquer them\\
to gain bliss by the victory.\\
As though I'm weaving muja-grass\\
proclaiming no retreat: shame upon life\\
defeated here — better to die in battle now\\
than choose to lie on in defeat.\\
Ascetics and brahmins there are found\\
that have surrendered here, and they\\
are seen no more: they do not know\\
the paths the pilgrim travels by.\\
So, seeing Mara's squadrons now\\
arrayed all round, with elephants,\\
I sally forth to ﬁght, that I\\
may not be driven from my post.\\
Your serried squadrons, which the world\\
with all its gods cannot defeat,\\
Now I'll break with wisdom sharp\\
as with a stone a raw clay pot.\\
With all mind's thoughts within the range,\\
with well-established mindfulness,\\
I'll travel on from state to state\\
many disciples leading out.\\
They, both diligent and resolute\\
carry on my S\=asana\\
and though you like it not, they'll go\\
to where they do not grieve.

Though step by step for seven years\\

``Shall I find something soft in this?
And is there something tasty here?"\\

\chapter{Subh\=asita Sutta The Well-spoken}

Thus have l heard:
At one time the Radiant One dwelt at Savatthi, in the ]eta Grove, Anathapindika's Park. The Radiant One spoke thus: `Bhikkhus'.\\
`Venerable Sir', those bhikkhus replied.\\
`Speech having four qualities is well-spoken, not ill-spoken; what is Dharma, not what is not-Dharma; what is kindly, not what is unkind; what is the truth, not what is false. This speech is well-spoken, not ill-spoken and blameless not blameworthy among the wise.'\\

This is what the Radiant One said, then he spoke further.

\begin{MyDescription}[\arabic{stanza}]{}
Now peaceful Ones say: first speak the well-spoken\\
and second, speak Dharma but not its opposite,\\
what's kind do speak, third, not the unkind,\\
while fourth, speak the truth but never the false.
\stepcounter{stanza}
\end{MyDescription}
 
Then the venerable Vangisa rose with robe over one shoulder and lotussed hands towards the Radiant One saying to him: `Sir, it has come to me!'\\

`Let it come to you, Vangisa.'

The venerable Vangisa then praised the Radiant One in his presence with these appropriate verses:

\begin{MyDescription}[\arabic{stanza}]{}
Only that speech should be spoken\\
from which harm does not come to oneself\\
nor torment brings upon others,\\
this truly is speech that's well-spoken.
\stepcounter{stanza}
\end{MyDescription}

\begin{MyDescription}[\arabic{stanza}]{}
Speak only those words that are kind,\\
the speech that is gladly received,\\

conveying no evil, is kind.

\section{Notes}
This small Sutta is important for Dharma-practice. It is easier to make unwholesome karma by way of the mouth than it is through bodily action — words just slip off the tongue so easily. Think how many words one speaks every day! So the Buddha here defines what is subh\=asita, well-spoken. He does this twice, first in prose and then in a summary verse, a mnemonic aid in a world where teachings were not recorded even by writing.\\

To ensure that this teaching stuck in the mind, Venerable Vang\=asa, famous for his ability to speak inspired and spontaneous verse, then with the Buddha's approval, elaborates upon these four types of good speech. This occasion does not bring forth his best verses.\\

This sutta also occurs in S. (Vangisa-sa\.myutta 8,5) though there it has no occasion nor the Buddha s prose and verse.\\

Vs. 453 mentions `the ancient Dharma'. The word translated here as `ancient' is `sanantano' which PTSD defines as `primeval, of old, for ever, eternal'. When used as an adjective with `dharma' the meaning is that this Dharma is true: ``Whether Tath\=agatas (or Buddhas) arise or Tath\=agatas do not arise, there is this state of causality that always exists, this established order of dharmas, this natural lawfulness of Dharma, that is to say: All conditioned things are impermanent...all conditioned things are dukkha...all dharmas are not-self..." This is the ancient Dharma true of all worlds, of all beings, at all times, whether or not it is known to these beings. For the above quotation see A. Threes 134.

The Hindu understanding of the Skt. `sanatana-dharma' emphasizes time — that this Dharma is eternal and includes among other matters the society ordered into castes. This view is defended in the Bhagavad-g\=ata. [Comment in text: “a reference here!”]

\chapter{Sundar\=akabharadv\=ada Sutta\\ To Sundhar\=akabharadv\=aja on Offerings}

Thus have I heard:\\

At one time the Radiant One was dwelling among the Kosalans. At that time the brahmin Sundar\=aka-Bharadv\=aja performed on the bank of the Sundar\=aka river the fire sacrifice and offered the fire-ritual. Having completed the sacrifice and ritual the brahmin rose from his seat and surveyed the four directions, thinking, `Who will partake of the remains of this sacrifice?' It happened then that the brahmin saw the Radiant One seated at the foot of a tree not far away but with his head covered. Seeing him, the brahmin grasped the sacrificial remains in his left hand and a water-vessel in his right and approached the Radiant One who, hearing his approach, uncovered his head. Then the brahmin thought:\\
`This venerable one is shaven-headed, a mere shaveling' and desired to turn back. But it occurred to him: `Though shaven~headed there are some brahmins here like this. It would be good to inquire about his `birth'. Then Sund\=araka-Bharadv\=aja the brahmin approached the Radiant One and having done so, said this: `Of what `birth' is the venerable one?' Then the Radiant One addressed these verses to the brahmin: 

\begin{MyDescription}[\arabic{stanza}]{The Buddha:}
No brahmin am I, nor son of royalty,\\
nor of merchant stock, nor any other (caste),\\
for l know very well ordinary people's line\\
so wisely, having nothing, I fare through the world.

When this was said, the brahmin Sundar\=aka-Bharadv\=aja said to the Radiant
   One: `Magniﬁcent, master Gotama! The Dharma has been clarified by Master
   Gotama in many ways, as though he was righting what was overthrown, revealing
   what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding a lamp in the
   dark so that those with eyes can see forms. I go for Refuge to Master Gotama, to
   the Dharma, and to the Bhikkhu-sangha that I may receive the Leaving home
   from the venerable Gotama with ordination.' Then the brahmin Sundar\=aka-
   Bharadv\=aja received this. Not long after his ordination the venerable, living in
   solitude, secluded, diligent and zealous by realizing from himself with Direct
   Knowledge here and now entered upon and abided in that supreme goal of the
   Good Life for the sake of which clansmen rightly leave home for homelessness.
   He Knew directly: birth is destroyed, the Good Life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being. And the venerable Sundar\=aka-Bharadv\=aja became one of the arahants.

\chapter{M\=agha Sutta\\ To M\=agha an Giving}
Thus have I heard:\\

At one time the Radiant one dwelt at R\=ajagaha on the Vulture Peak Mountain. Then the young brahmin M\=agha went to the Radiant One and exchanged greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down to one side and spoke thus to the Radiant One: `Master Gotama, I am certainly a donor, one who is generous and glad to comply with others' requests. From wealth sought rightly, obtained rightly, acquired in  accordance with Dharma, I give to one, two, ten, twenty, a hundred or even more — so do I, Master Gotama giving and bestowing in this way accrue much merit?'\\

`Certainly young brahmin, giving and bestowing in this way you accrue much merit. lf anyone is a donor, one who is generous and glad to comply with others' requests from wealth sought rightly, obtained rightly, acquired in accordance with dharma and given to one, two, ten, twenty, a hundred or even to more, that one accrues much merit.'\\

Then the brahmin youth M\=agha addressed these verses to the Radiant One:

\chapter{Sela Sutta -\\ To Sela and his praise of the Buddha}


Thus have I heard:\\
At one time the Radiant One was journeying through the lands of the Anguttarapans, accompanied by a large sangha of bhikkhus, twelve hundred and fifty of them and arrived at a town called \=apana.\\

The ascetic Keniya of the Dreadlocked Hair heard this: `The Samana Gotama, son of the Sakiyans who left home among the Sakiyan people has been journeying among the Anguttarapans accompanied by a large sangha of bhikkhus, twelve hundred and fifty of them and he has arrived in apana. Now an excellent report has spread to this effect: The Radiant One is Arahant, fully Awakened, perfect in true knowledge and conduct, whose going is auspicious, knower of worlds, incomparable leader of people to be famed, Teacher of devas and humanity, Awakened and Radiant. He declares this world with its devas, maras, princes and people which he has realized by direct knowledge himself. He teaches Dharma good at the beginning, the middle and the end, complete with purpose and meaning, revealing the good life, that which is completely fulfilled and wholly purified. Now, it is good to see such Arahants.\\

 Then Keniya of the Dreadlocked Hair went to see the Radiant One and exchanged greetings with him and when that courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down to one side. The Radiant One instructed, urged, roused and encouraged him with Dharma-talk after which Keniya said, `Let Master Gotama together with the Sangha of bhikkhus consent to accept tomorrow's meal from me.'\\
 
 The Radiant One replied to him, `The Sangha of bhikkhus Keniya, is large, of twelve hundred and ﬁfty. Do remember that [?] you believe also in the brahmins.'\\
 
 This request was repeated a second and a third time by Keniya and only on the third occasion did the Buddha accept by remaining silent.\\

\chapter{V\=aise\~n\~na Sutta (=M98)\\  To V\=aise\~n\~na upon who is a brahmin.}

 
 
Thus have l heard:\\
At one time the Radiant One was dwelling at lcch\=anangala. Now at that time a number of notable and prosperous brahmins were staying at lcch\=anangala, that is to say the brahmins Cank\=a, T\=arukkha, Pokkharas\=ati, J\=anussoni and Todeyya, as well as other notable and prosperous brahmins.\\

 Then, as the young brahmins D\=ase\~n\~nha and Bh\=aradvaia were walking and wandering for exercise this subject of discussion arose between them. `How is one a brahmin?' The young brahmin Bh\=aradvaja said, `When one is well-born on both sides, or pure maternal and paternal descent through seven generations in the past, then one is a brahmin'. But V\=ase\~n\~nha the young brahmin said, `When I one is virtuous and fulfils one's vows, then one is a brahmin'. Bh\=aradvaja could not convince Vase\~n\~nha while the latter failed to convince the former. Then Vase\~n\~nha said to Bh\=aradvaja, `Sir, the samana Gotama son of the Sakyas who left home from the Sakyan clan is living at lcch\=anangala, in the forest near lcch\=anangala. Now the good reputation of Master Gotama has spread in this way: That Radiant One is accomplished, completely Awakened, possessed of True Knowledge and conduct well~gone for himself and others, knower of the worlds, unexcelled trainer of those who can be tamed, teacher of devas and humanity, Awake and Radiant. Come, Bharadvaja, let us go to the samana Gotama and ask him about this. As he replies so will we bear his words in mind.\\

`Yes, sir', Bharadvaja replied.\\

So the two young brahmins approached the Radiant One and exchanged greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was concluded, they sat down to one side and the young brahmin Vase\~n\~nha addressed the Radiant One in verse:

\begin{MyDescription}[\arabic{stanza}]{V\=ase\~n\~nha:}

\section{Notes upon the Vasennha Sutta}
As the Buddha has defined what he means by the word `outcaste', vasala, in the Sutta of that name (Sn. 116-142), so here he discourses with two young brahmins on what makes one a true brahmin. Both outcaste and brahmin are defined according to Dharma, what one should avoid in the first case and what one should do in the second.\\

In the society of the Buddha's days (still found in present Indian attitudes), the brahmins reckoned themselves the highest among all the castes having been born of a brahmin mother and father whose families were `pure' brahminical stock back through seven generations on both sides. It was enough to have such parents and families to be born as a brahmin, they reckoned. Moreover, according to legend the brahmins came from the head, the uppermost part of primeval man, while other castes originated from me lower parts of that body, the outcastes being merely the dust upon that first man's feet. Such grounds for superiority with exclusive knowledge of Vedic rites and mysteries, endowed many brahmin men with a very inflated idea of their own importance. (Women of brahmin families though in very early times also possessed knowledge of the Three (or four) Vedas together with ritual and correct transmission through chanting, lost this eminence and came to be regarded by brahmin men as just mothers of their sons).\\


The verses of this sutta can divided into a number of sections, each one with distinct bearing upon the questions: What makes one a brahmin, `birth' as explained above, or karma — the results of intentional actions, speech and body. These sections are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Vaseﬁﬁha's laudatory and questioning verses (5 94-5 99).
\item The Buddha's analysis of Living things (600-61 l).
\item His deﬁnition of who is not a brahmin (612-619).
\item His verses upon who is a true Brahmin (620-647).
\item His concluding verses upon `caused by karma' (648~656)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{V\=ase\~n\~nha's laudatory and questioning verses}
For words of praise in the Teacher's presence see my short essay among the introductory material of this book. The verses open with Vase\~n\~nha telling the Buddha who were their respective teachers, as well as their own attainments, a sort of verbal curriculum vitae. With this they are communicating their attainments as brahmins thereby informing him of the sort of people he will be addressing. However, this is done with a great deal of politeness by inserting such laudatory titles as `One-with-Eyes', `Wide Awake' and so on. They raise their lotussed hands, probably to their foreheads but at least to their hearts, marking their respect for the teacher they are questioning.

\subsection{The Buddha's analysis of living things}
In these verses most of them have the refrain `each species possessing its own marks/form many are the sorts of birth', except for the first one which as only the latter line. lt is important to remember that the word `birth' had (and has) a very special meaning in India. Asking another person (not uncommon even in modem India) about his or her `birth', is the equivalent to enquiring about the caste of their family. This is required before one eats or drinks with other unknown people and of course if marriage is contemplated. High caste persons (those from brahmin or noble families) can lose their status through pollution' by eating or drinking with, or having with those of low caste according to brahminical laws. The Buddha points out in the first few of these verses (600-606), that among the groups he describes there are many sorts of birth. These verses are to highlight specific differentiation as opposed to what is found among human beings as made clear in verses 607-611. in other words, all human beings whatever their caste, colour, race or language , are the same, with the same organs and characteristics. in the last verse in this section the Buddha notes that differences are merely nominal. In India this refers to `birth' or caste, in the rest of the world to class, family, wealth, education etc. Such matters are only conventional, not of the essence.\\

The Buddha is thus revealed as the first person ever to reject racism in any form. All human beings are basically the same in that they can all practise the Dharma and experience the Awakened State. People are only `high' or `low' according to Dharma by their behaviour. Elsewhere, the Buddha noted that one is noble by thought, speech and action, not by worldly ennoblement. The word for noble in P\=ali/Sanskrit is ariya/\=arya conventionally meaning a high caste person, from the clans of self-styled \=aryans invading India from around 1500 BCE onwards. But the Buddha's interpretation of this word emphasized the nobility of mind, speech and body actions. Such nobility has no boundaries of race, caste, class or language.\\

notice that in verse 610 the Buddha denies that there are essential differences in `colour'. This is va\=o\=oa in P\=ali, varna in Sanskrit, and has the general meaning in India of superior birth or inferior. High-caste people are supposed to have light colours of skin, while workers and outcasts are dark in complexion. However this myth does not always work out as many brahmins in the south of the country are very nearly black! Paired with `colour' is `sound', meaning a polished way of speech or an uneducated one. lt is possible to distinguish the caste a person belongs to by listening to their speech. Some words will point out a brahmin background, others will only be used by outcastes.\\

The last verse in this section makes it clear that the only differences among human beings are merely nominal. A man is only tradition a brahmin or an outcaste, there are no essential differences.

\subsection{The Buddha's definition of who is not a brahmin.}
Verses 612-619 define by a nominally brahmin-caste man's work how he could not be a brahmin, that is, he doesn't not live up to the high standard set by the Buddha to qualify for the title of `brahmin'. As the Buddha did not accept that one could be spiritually advanced merely by being born of brahmin-caste parents, so neither was one even nominally a brahmin when one's livelihood had nothing to do with caste labels. Nominal brahmins in the Buddha's days had departed from their ancient religious ideals and had become over time farmers, craftsmen, even rulers. They should not be counted even as nominal brahmins and certainly not as Brahmins, those who are spiritually advanced.\\

In this book I have used `brahmin' (lower-case) to mean one of brahmin parents and caste. Capitalized `Brahmin' refers to one who is purified by Dharma practice. In English we can, while not altering the spelling, change its meaning by using either a capital or lower-case letter. Note that this is not possible in Indian scripts which have no such distinction.\\

Verse 618 could surprise many brahmins who perform rituals and ceremonies and are paid for this, as the Buddha denies that one can be a Brahmin just by carrying out traditional pujas and so on. Such a person is only a priest. Priests of this sort may recite the rituals in Sanskrit but not even know the meaning of what they chant. They have learnt by heart the sounds but not the meaning. Often these ceremonies may be marked by gabbling the words at high speed. Unfortunately such behaviour can be found also among some Buddhist monks, equally bored and ignorant of their traditions. 

\subsection{IV. The Buddha's verses upon who is a true Brahmin.}
These (620-647) are found also and nearly identical in the P\=ali Dhammapada in the Brahmanavagga. All have the refrain, `one such I say's a Brahmin then'. This ideal brahmin who would be either completely Awake or far along the Dharma-path to Awakening illustrates the Buddha's interpretation of a truly honourable and marvellously spiritual person. These verses serve in India to remind ordinary brahmins how they should behave, a high ideal indeed!\\

 A few notes follow upon sundry matters in these verses:

\begin{itemize}
   
\item[620] The Buddha contrasts ordinary ideas of birth — `born from brahmin mother's line' with the real Brahmin of 'owning nothing and unattached.'

\item[621] No fetters, no ties, no bonds equals no anxiety, no trembling, nothing to fear.

\item[622] Freedom from being yoked and so a Buddha.

\item[623] Abuse, torture, imprisonment all endured without anger developing patience as one's `weapon'.

\item[624] Basics for becoming a true Brahmin, truly Awake.

\item[625] Water on a lotus-leaf or flower forms into beads like mercury and runs off, it never spreads out because of the saponitic surface of the whole plant. Likewise a mustard seed drops of a needle point.

\item[626] `Exhaustion of all dukkha' means the causes (karma, etc) producing dukkha in the past have been exhausted by good made in the present. `Laid down the burden' is freedom from all attachment to the notion `my body' and my mind' and every other sort of possessiveness.

\item[627] if one practises Dharma one should leam what is the Path and what is not. Then one should practise accordingly. The `highest aim' is then not impossible.

\item[628] A verse specially for meditative bhikkhus, munis or other solitary practitioners. (Solitary practice should only be undertaken with the advice and approval of one's Dharma teacher)

\item[629] Force used against other beings, human or other, as well as its use internally against oneself, can never achieve the good results of lasting peace. Politicians who advocate violent means to `resolve' others' violence and religious fanatics who, driven by wrong views, preach and practise violence against the followers of sects or religions differing from their own,— all of them are blinded by delusion and never learn even a little from the facts of human history. No good comes of violence and even less may be expected as a result of killing.
   MS PaI!:Z86
   
   
\item[630] Specially suitable for one of strong passions! Because one's character is fiery this does not mean that one cannot practice, in fact the energies of the passions can be turned round into wisdom and compassion.

\item[631] Mustard seeds which are small still cannot remain upon a needle-point, so for the the practitioner there is no room for lust, hate, conceit, etc.

\item[632] There are fortunately still people like this in our turbulent world. When reading this verse, l think with gratitude of Ven. Pal(????)vaddho \=acariya, my very kind and wise teacher many years ago.


\item[633] Dharma is the way of giving, generosity and letting-go, quite different to the world's way of greed, taking, hoarding and selfishness.

\item[634] Longings for this world's joys and properties are common while longings for the next world are found among the followers of most religions. The latter feel they are superior to those who merely long for worldly pleasure and power but their `spiritual' longing is still an attachment. They must be longingless and free from bonds'.

\item[635] Until Awakening occurs there is always doubt. `Final knowledge' a(???)a/a(???)a) once experienced dissolves away all doubt. The profound (note in text) knowledge of deathlessness ls another way of saying this'. 

\item[636] Some are bound by their tendencies to evil and cause themselves and others much dukkha. But others are attached to their goodness and sometimes feels themselves superior, looking down upon those who seem to them not virtuous. This is also a bondage.

\item[637] Love of being means attachment to existence, not being able to let go of life, even at the time of death. lt certainly means, or implies, more samsaric existence, on and on, round and round turns the samsara wheel. 

\item[638] `Wandering-on' is my old translation of `samsara' which means literally `wandering and wandering'. The path through samsara is always difficult because it is guided by delusion, with greed and hatred too. This is also the fuel which keeps these three fires burning. When these fires go out (where do they go to? Do fires `go' anywhere when extinguished?) there is the Cool Peace of Nirvana.

\item[639] `Homeless one renouncing all': this could be as a bhikkhu or bhikkhunis in monastic community, or as a muni living a solitary life. (One munis see vv. 207-221, 679-723, 835-847,848-861). `Renounce' means letting go from the heart, not a forced `renunciation' which will only create inner conflicts, tension and dukkha generally. lf practised correctly then all desires subside by themselves.

\item[640] Craving is consumed by itself with good Dhanna practice. lt does not require any force to be used.

\item[641] We all know something of human limitations and attachments, our bonds in this world. But then we have to know thoroughly `the bonds of gods' — spiritual bondage such as to the delights that occur through meditation practice, even bliss. lt often happens to those who devote their live to spiritual practice that they become ensnared by these extra-human experiences, especially if they follow a teaching that preaches heaven as salvation. From a Buddhist perspective this is confusion: `heaven(s)' mean the deva-worlds, some sensual and some of refined spirituality but all of them as existences in the round of birth and death. `Salvation' is something different from the deva-realms, as these verses point out.

\item[642] Without assets: this translation of an-upad/1i is Ven. Nyanamoli's term. Upadhi is a P\=ali word with a great range of meaning but generally refers to what is grasped at, what one is attached to. Later Commentators have expanded these varieties of upadhi, as any Buddhist Dictionary will make clear. Think generally of `assets' as what one assumes that one owns such as mind and body. One is an `All-worlds conqueror' not by the use of force, armies and wars, but rather by being free of any attachment to all of the possible states of existence.

\item[643] This advice is continued from the last verse. Faring well means practising the Dharma. To fare is one of only two English words which can convey the meaning of the P\=ali verb: carati, both to go on a journey, and to practise a spiritual path. The other word is `to course'.

\item[644] Those Awake, do not `go' anywhere at death, while the ordinary unenlightened persons do go — to some other existence. The state of Awakened Ones cannot be explained in words, as no language exists that has words for what is beyond all words, even all holy ones.

\item[645] `Ownership before or after or midway': this has three possible meanings. first, it has the meaning of unattachment while practising generosity, dana; one has no regrets about giving either while planning it, or while actually giving or after having given. Second, `before' means past lives, `after' refers to future, while midway is this present life. Third refers to the Awakened person of whom it can be said: `owning nothing, and unattached' — time does not apply since its limitations have been transcended.

\item[646] A list of praiseworthy qualities of those Awake. References to heroes' and `conquerors' means those who continue to practise Dharma even in difficult situations, and who `conquer' or overcome all obstructions. `Washes' refer to one purified of all mental-emotional troubles though the P\=ali word `uh\=ataka\=u' originally meant the ritual purificatory bathing in rivers by brahmins.

\item[647] This ﬁrst line on `former births' is one of many references in the P\=ali suttas to lives before this one. Of course they have gone, they are past and we cannot practise in them. But they did exist and helped to shape our present existence. Those westerners who try not to take thin into account and who obviously have no experience of previous existences, distort the Buddha's teaching's. `The waste of births' can also be translation as `exhaustion', ***Comment [SW2] discuss with laurence*** their cessation because karma no longer exists to cause them to appear.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Buddha's concluding verses upon `caused by karma'.}
The last nine of these verses in this sutta bring together the various strands of Dharma taught here. ln the first of these verses (648) the Buddha emphasizes how names and families are only conventional descriptions having no ultimate meaning, they are the only to the extent that they are accepted within their own language, culture and convention. As these factors change so will the meaning of names. The Buddha's Awakening showed him that the accepted conventions were sometimes untruthful, even evil and then did not accord with Dharma.\\

This is why in verse 649 he refers to `those asleep, unquestioning' who take words and names as ultimate truth. `Taking up views' is a technical term for those who seize upon beliefs as true, whose beliefs (views) cannot be verified and upon a deeper level who blindly follow the basic view of `I am'. From that flow all other views. ln numerous places in the sutta the Buddha has shown the evil results of the belief in `I am', ranging from mild conflicts, round to persecutions, wars and `racial cleansing'. People, blind like this, not surprisingly by tradition uphold such views as `one's a brahmin just by birth.'\\

Verse 650 puts the Buddhist view: that it is karma not `birth' that is responsible for one's status. Were it governed by `birth' there is nothing could be changed — just grin and bear it. This is in fact the Hindu position (particularly in the Bhagavadg\=ata) that those of low castes should just accept their station in life and work unquestioningly for high caste people. But the Buddha taught that there are four types of people: one who goes from dark to dark, one from dark to light, one from light to dark, one from light to light (A. Fours.85). This has nothing to do with `birth', whether understood in the brahminical sense, or in western' society. There are many historical examples in both of those who started their lives in poor families but by diligence ended up in the light, while plenty of cases can be found of those from families of high repute who yet degenerated due to their internal tendencies to greed, hatred and delusion, as well as to external conditions.\\

The next verse, 651, may raise questions, even eyebrows, even voices. We learn from the verse that farmers, craftsmen, merchants and servants have those occupations due to karma, not due to their societal status or `birth'. This seems to be only a very short skip to the Hindu caste position of determined occupation due to past karma. This will not seem unpleasant if one's present fortunate birth is karma-caused. One has plenty of comforts and easy access to education and so on. But this takes on a quite different aspect if the present birth is among the poverty-stricken and down-trodden.\\

I suggest that the Buddha lists these commons occupations of his times (to which we would add a host of types of work found in our days) to point out that people choose their preferred work (if they have that choice) on the basis of v\=asan\=a: This term refers to the repetitive karma in a past life(s). To examples from my own life: I enjoyed learning from books and (when found) good teachers though my interests quite excluded sports and sciences. This v\=asan\=a, tendency or predilection was part of my character from childhood. So was another tendency to interest in Ethiopia. None of my family had been there yet throughout my teens and twenties I met continually people who had lived in the country — such as a girlfriend who had met the emperor Haile Selassie — and strengthened this interest. But then the great v\=asan\=a became apparent. As a British soldier in the Suez Canal Zone doing my National Service, I read the book Buddhism” by Christmas Humphreys (still in print!) during the course of one day, all 240 pages of it, and at the end knew without a doubt that I was a Buddhist.\\

So perhaps the Buddha intended to suggest that people's occupation to some extent depends upon these tendencies which draw people towards not only being farmers craftsmen, merchants and sen/ants but also (652) to being robbers, soldiers, priests and rulers. it is no coincidence that these four are found in one Verse.\\

653-4. Karma as a process, a very complex one, does really work in the mind and can by advanced practitioners be seen and known. This means that it is not a theory or mere belief. One of the six True Knowledges possessed by the Buddha was the Knowledge of others' karma and results, and since his time many famous Teachers have had this ability. `Seers of causal relatedness' refers to those who see Dependent Origination for themselves. `People by karma circle round' means that they continue to go round the Wheel of birth and death, while `beings are by karma bound' means that the vast majority of them have no choice about where they will go in their next existence. That has already been decided by the predominant sorts of karmas that they have `made. The only beings to have any choice in this are those upon the path — streamwinners or Bodhisattvas. The surety about this is reinforced by the simile: the well-secured linchpin that holds the chariot's wheel to the axle. New karma in a different direction can sometimes block out, though probably not dissolve, karma completely.\\

To encourage the young brahmins so that they did not feel that their futures were deterministically limited the Buddha spoke the next verse showing them what they had to practise. `Ardour' (tapo) was a word well-known to brahmins. To them it meant, and still means, some sort of austerity, sometimes very severe self-torture aimed at purification according to Hindus but disapproved of by the Buddha. In the Buddha's Dharma tapo means making an effort, even if this is difficult and involves renunciation. lt should not involved the harm of oneself. `Good Life” (brahmacariya) is a life based on Dharma of moral conduct
(\=sala), meditation (sam\=adhi) and wisdom (pa\~n\~n\=a, praj\~n\=a). it may or may not involve celibacy and the adoption of a monastic life, or a solitary one (muni). With this son of `restraint and taming' one becomes a true Brahmin, that is, Awakened.\\

To elaborate upon this, verse 656 mentions the triple true knowledges (vijj\=a, vidy\=a) which meant quite different things to brahmins and to Buddhists. Brahmins understood `te vijj\=a' to mean complete knowledge of the Three Vedas, their most ancient `scriptures'. (As they were learnt by heart and chanted not written down they should really be called `chantures'). Buddhists understood these words to mean: l. memory of one's previous births (lives); 2. the divine eye — ability to see distant events, people, etc.; 3. the e)exhaustion of the inﬂows (\=asava), the inﬂows of karma sensual desire, the inflow for continued existence, and the inflow of (holding) views. Sometimes a fourth inflow is added: the inflow of ignorance.\\

Possessed of Triple Knowledges', which are not `possessed' in the normal sense as there is by that time no one to possess them, goes along with `Peace' but not merely the peace experience by a good meditator, but Awakening's Peace, Repeated being' — desire for more existence — is exhausted with no desire either for it or against it.\\

The last part of the verse compares a person with these attainments to Brahma and Sakra. As the two important Hindu devas would be revered by their followers, so should an Awakened one be treated. This is rather an interesting end to these verses, an end specially spoken by the Buddha to inspire them as brahmins to practise the Dharma.


   
\chapter{Kok\=aliya Sutta - To Kok\=aliya an the results of slanderous speech}

Thus have I heard:\\

At one time the Radiant One was dwelling at Jeta's Grove in the park of An\=athapindika near S\=avatthi. Now at that time the bhikkhu Kok\=aliya approached the Radiant One and having done so saluted him and sat down to one side. Seated there Kok\=aliya bhikkhu said this to the Radiant One: Sir, S\=ariputta and Moggall\=ana are of evil desires, under the inﬂuence of evil desires. When this was said the Radiant One spoke to the bhikkhu Kok\=aliya: don't this Kok\=aliya, don't say so! Clear your mind towards S\=ariputta and Moggall\=ana for they are very friendly. A second time Kok\=aliya repeated his allegation and the Radiant One replied in the same way. An even a third time Kok\=aliya spoke his accusation and the Radiant One replied.\\

After this the bhikkhu Kok\=aliya rose from his seat, saluted the Radiant One and circumambulating him, keeping him on the right, departed. Only a short time after he left, Kok\=aliya's whole body broke out in boils the size of mustard seeds, then grew to the size of green-gram, then to chickpeas, then to jujube seeds, then to jujube fruits, then to myrobalan fruits, then to young bael fruits, then to mature bael fruits and when they had reached this size all over his body, blood and pus was discharged and Kok\=aliya died. After death he appeared in the Paduma Hell as a result of hardening his heart against S\=ariputta and Moggall\=ana.\\

Then as the night passed, Brahma Sahampati of great radiance illuming the whole of Jetavana, came to the Radiant One and after saluting him stood to one side and said this: Venerable, the bhikkhu Kok\=aliya has done his time — died and appeared subsequently in the Paduma Hell as a result of hardening his heart against S\=ariputta and Moggall\=ana. When this was said, a certain bhikkhu spoke to the Radiant One thus: How long, venerable, is life in the Paduma Hell? Bhikkhu, life in the Paduma hell is surely long, not easy to reckon in terms of years, of hundreds of years, of thousand of years, in tens of hundreds of thousands of years. But can a simile be made, sir? It can, bhikkhu. Suppose that there was a Kosalan cartload of twenty measures of sesame seed and that from this a man might take a single seed every century. That Kosalan cartload of twenty measures of sesame seeds would be more quickly used up in that way than would lifetime in the Paduma Hell. Moreover, bhikkhu, there are twenty lifetimes in the Abbuda Hell to equal one in Nirabbuda Hell...\\

twenty in Nirabbuda to equal one Ababa...\\

twenty in Ababa to equal one Ahaha...\\

twenty in Ahaha to equal one A\~na\~na...\\

twenty in A\~na\~na... one Kumuda...one Sogandhika...one Uppalaka one Pund\=arika...one Paduma. It is in Paduma that Kok\=aliya bhikkhu has arisen for hardening his heart against S\=ariputta and Moggall\=ana.\\

 The Radiant One spoke thus and having said this spoke further (these verses).\\

\section{Some Reflections on `Hell'}
There are a few P\=ali texts centred upon this subject but the present Sutta is the only one of these found in Sn. the subject of the hell-realms (niraya in P\=ali,naraka in Skt.) is rare when compared to the vast recorded teachings of the Buddha. Mention of it occurs always in the context of some serious wrongdoing, for peccadilloes do not result in the experience of hell. Another point to consider is that as `all conditioned things are impermanent' (sabbe sa\=ikh\=ar\=a anicc\=a, Dhp.), hell certainly is conditioned by the causes that have led to its suffering, so it is impermanent, as are all other forms of existence. In this it differs from the hell of theistic religions which they sometimes have proclaimed as eternal. Buddhist teachings could not agree that impermanent cause, even the slaughter of millions of men, could have permanent results, so even such monsters as Hitler, Stalin and Ma-tse-tun could not suffer hell forever. However, all texts are agreed that it continues for a very long time. `Hell' is not a translation of viraya favoured by some because of the eternalistic overtone which does not apply to the Buddhist meaning and so prefer `purgatory'. I have used `hell' here as it is a direct and brief term fitting well into verse, and applicable to both the great sufferings experienced by evil-doers whether in the eternalist religions or in the Buddhadharma.\\

The wrong-doer in this Sutta is a bhikkhu called Kok\=aliya (in Sn.) or Kok\=alika (in other Pali texts). In any case his name means `one from the town of Kok\=ali'. His story, the essence of which is his slander of the Buddha's chief disciples, S\=ariputta and Moggall\=ana, in the presence of the Buddha saying that these two enlightened monks were of evil desires, and they are influenced by evil desires'. Presumably he repeated this allegation to others as well. According to the texts this resulted in a plague of boils all over his body and we could speculate whether modern medicine could or could not find a cure for these. The P\=ali commentators presumably would deny that any cure was possible as the affliction was brought about by evil karma. Then Kok\=aliya died of his illness and the text relates that he found himself immediately in hell. As this frightful experience is usually connected with great anger and violence and though in this case it seems to be motivated by envy and because this touches upon a doctrine of the heavy results of doing evil to the Nobles ones (ariya), it should be examined in brief here.\\

This teaching, found in its fullest development in the P\=ali Comys, assigns degrees of painful karmic results according to the attainment of the recipients. Thus, injuring a Buddha causes in the wrongdoer the worst and longest sufferings while attacking ordinary persons, including monks and nuns will not have such bad consequences, with all shades of karma results between. This is a questionable doctrine as explained below and my lead us to doubt whether we should accept this Sutta as the Buddha-word (Buddhavacana) or not.\\

The Buddha's teaching on Karma is clear and straightforward. A decision in the mind is mental karma, a decision to speak and one has made vocal karma and if this is followed by deliberate action this is called bodily karma, the last two are of course guided by mind. These three actions or karmas may be motivated by greed, hatred and delusion in which case they are called `unwholesome karma' the results of which will be painful, or by non-greed (=generosity), non-hatred (loving-kindness and compassion), or by non-delusion (=wisdom) in which case such karma is called `wholesome' and the results of it to be experienced sooner or later will be pleasant. The initial decision to think, say and do is taken in the mind and the following results are experienced, for happiness or suffering in both mind and body. This sutta concerns unwholesome karma with painful results.\\

Then, there is also this teaching, albeit rather uncommon in the P\=ali Suttas, that good karma made towards Enlightened persons has much greater results for the doer, than good expressed towards ordinary people who of course may include beggars or other poverty stricken or ill people. Such emphasis, found in the P\=ali Comys and much in evidence in Buddhist countries means that those who are supposed to be enlightened or on their way to Enlightenment, receive very generous donations while care of the poor, the diseased, the criminal and the mad receive little, as the doer's merit will be insignificant because these people are not pu(??)avanta — those possessing merit. This cannot be correct! Suppose a good-hearted person wishes to alleviate the sufferings of those poor people, doing this out of loving-kindness and compassion, one cannot say that his or her merit will be little. Why? Because this person is compassionate, with good intentions.\\

In the case of Kok\=aliya he is said to have uttered envious and untruthful words about the two enlightened disciples in the Buddha's presence. Result; a frightful disease followed by a long stay in exceedingly uncomfortable surroundings. Had he uttered the same words about an ordinary fellow-monk or lay-supporter, presumably his kan"nic result would have been quite insignificant. Does this sound like the rational teaching of karma and its results? No, because there is an unexplained and probably inexplicable cause or condition involving the noble attainments of the great disciples, which condition has seriously lengthened his terrible karmic results.\\

It is proper to mention here that the other side of this doctrine, doing good towards noble disciples, such as great generosity by donors, has also a deleterious result. As they are reputed to be Awakened, such Teachers attract lay-donors who wish to make merit, sure that their gifts will bring them good results in the future. These Teachers are then showered by gifts which have no place in their lives and which may be difficult for them to dispose of.\\

Summing up this point; the doctrine of variable results of karma according the recipient's spiritual status is at least questionable though widely believed in. It may be objected that the Dharma's working are not mechanistic or totally rational. This is true for the Dharma in some aspects transcends rationalism, as for example the presence of supernormal powers in some living teachers or the bodily relics in the ashes of some great teacher's cremation.\\

Hell's depictions in many religious traditions have remarkable similarities. Such murals and paintings on cloth and in books are usually explained as efforts to evoke fear of retribution among evildoers. Whether such pictures are successful or not the writer does not know though controlling the impulses to evil by evoking fear cannot be the best way of teaching people Dharma. But he does know that Teacher, Acharn Singthong, in N.E. Thailand, controlled an outbreak of rustling water-buffalo in the locality by such means. This Teacher, highly respected by the villagers, gave to them on a Full Moon night a sermon lasting about three hours on the hell-realms. The audience of monks, nuns and laypeople, were spellbound and no one even changed position on the hard boards of the floor of Wat Pa Geow's hall. One could have heard a pin drop. Buffalo-rustling ceased immediately. perhaps it is true then that some people will only practise the Dharma after being scared of the results of evil-doing.\\

As a matter related to this Sutta it should be remembered that without the operation of the senses and the assembling of knowledge by mind there are no worlds, indeed, no existences. So when people raise the question, `Hells? Where are they?' the answer is that they exist where all worlds exist, including the one that we are aware of now, in the mind. One does not have to go anywhere to reach hell, just make the appropriate karma and hell is here. lt can continue to be here (where else would it be?) when an evildoer dies. Just as we make our own karmas to produce and continue with human life, so it is with other possibilities for existence, including hell. `The mind goes before all dharmas' as the famous first verse of the Dhammapada says.\\

Moving on now to examine the Sutta's structure, its composite nature soon becomes obvious. Kok\=aliya's story and some of the verses here (Sn. 657-660) have been popular and are preserved also at S.l.6.l0 and at A.Tens.89. This seems to be the earliest version around which other material has been added. For instance, Sn.661-662 are also Dhp.306\&125, while the remaining verses, Sn. 663-678 are an addition found only in Sn. These sixteen verses may be the work of one author who has written them in an unusual metre. 

\subsection{Particular points raised in the Sutta.}
In the introductory prose there is an example of a verbal convention in the Buddha's days: that of repeating a question or statement three times and receiving an answer also thrice repeated. ln this case Kok\=aliya repeats his allegations against the chief disciples three times while the Buddha warns him not to accuse them as they are `very friendly'. Indians in those days, not only Buddhists, according to the P\=ali Suttas seemed to regard this thrice-repeated, statement or question as bringing to a head or finally resolving the matter in hand. This could be illustrated in this way:

\begin{itemize}
\item   Statement/accusation
\item   Reply/warning
\item   x 3 = karmic result for speaker.
\item   Other examples: Sela questioning Keniya (Sn. 111.7)
\item   Did you say `Buddha?'
\item   Yes, l said `Buddha'
\item   x 3 = result: Sela and disciples went to the Buddha and were awakened.
\end{itemize}

Many more may be found in other Sutta collections. After Kok\=aliya has spoken three times against the pair of chief disciples and been reprimanded for this by the Buddha, he is recorded to have done a rather astonishing thing. Not only does he pay his respects to the Buddha (by lotussing his hands and bowing down probably from the standing position) but also as a greater mark of respect still he departs keeping the Buddha on his right side, that is, circumambulating him in a clockwise direction. Of course we shall never know if this is merely a commonly repeated phrase in P\=ali, or whether the miscreant Kok\=aliya actually did so. Though he could have done this out of mockery of the usual conventions of reverence, it could also be that his enmity was not at all directed at the Buddha but an obsession directed to the chief disciples.\\

Kok\=aliya's death through increasingly large `boils' needs a note upon the seeds and fruit they are compared to. Mustard seeds are very small, less than a thirty-secondth of an inch across. Green-grain is one of a family of similar pulses. which can be used for making Dahl. Chickpeas are also a familiar ingredient of Indian cookery to this day but being covered with boils of this size — up to one half-inch diameter, would already be very serious. Jujube fruit kernels would be larger assuming that this means what is now known as `Chinese dates' are in fact \textit{Zizyphus jujuba} and the whole fruit larger still. Myrobalan (\textit{Terminalia} spp. from India) produces an astringent fruit widely used in Ayurveda, and by Buddhist monks, the green fruit exceeding at least two jujubes. Bael (\textit{bilva} in P\=ali) is a tree in the Citrus family producing a good-tasting digestive flesh which is reached only by cracking a hard shell. Fruits vary in size from small ones easily held in one hand to `two-handers'. One shudders to think of `boils' of this size.\\

Another matter worth noting is the use of Brahma Sahampati as messenger of Kok\=aliya's fate. He serves to reinforce the Buddha's authority as the supposed utterer of this sutta. He is pictured as appearing to the Buddha in the last hours of the night and telling him what had happened to Kok\=aliya. After his disappearance the Buddha then relays this information to the bhikkhus and explains, in answer to a question, about the length of life in the Paduma Hell.\\

This is then explained, supposedly by the Buddha, in a complex piece of Buddhist arithmetic, all of which may be summed up by a more convenient expression in English as `a very, very long time'. The combination of Brahma Sahampati's appearance and the Buddha's `mathematical' calculations and the subsequent verses upon the horrors of hell may give us pause for thought when it comes to this Sutta's authenticity.\\

Various translators introduce into these verses the term `warders of hell' for which there is no word in the P\=ali text. These are perhaps assumed to exist and if this is so — certainly later Buddhist texts assume that such `warders' exist - then it raises a question. The inhabitants of the various states of existence including this human one, have appeared there (or here) due to the karma that they have created — so much is clear. But what are we to understand about `warders' who are said to intensify the sufferings of the inmates, as though they were commercially frying fish and chips, flipping them over and stirring them round in boiling oil? Are these supposed 'warders' present because they too have made much evil karma? But why should they have power over other inmates? One assumption is that they indeed have made such karma. Another, more subtle explanation is that the perception of `warders' by the inmates like the rest of the hellish landscape, is mind—made by the latter. This properly solves the presence of hellish `devils' as depicted not only in Buddhist art but in Christian murals also.\\

From verse 663 to the sutta's conclusion I have based my translation upon E.M. Hare's verses and occasionally used whole lines of his as he has often struck an appropriately colourful or gory note.

\section{Notes upon Sundry Words}

Subjects commented upon are italicized.\\

The Prologue\\

This visionary beginning to the Sutta has been translated rather into the form of alliterative Anglo-Saxon verse, perhaps not very successfully. Whether that is so or not a few matters deserve to be explained to the reader or chanter.\\

The Sage Asita appears rarely in P\=ali Suttas but as an important and well known person of those days. Obviously well-practised in jhana he had access through his meditation to visions and other worlds. On this occasion he saw the `Thirty-three' (sometimes called the 30 — for the Pali legend about them, see Dhammapada Commentary translated as Buddhist Legends, volume 3, p.315 ff). This realm of devas had a leader usually called \textit{Sakka} (skt. Sakra also Inda/Indra) who according to the Suttas became a devoted disciple of the Buddha. Naturally, Asita wanted to know why these devas were jubilant and so enquired.\\
 
He mentions a war with the anti-gods fought by these devas at some past time. Yes, as this is still the K\=ama-world, there is war even though it is a heaven! K\=ama, even when it is subtle, still produces conflict. The any'-gods is a translation of the P\=ali `a + sura', which literally means `not + god'. There are many stories about the asuras and their quarrelsome nature.\\


The Thirty-three devas are celebrating the birth of our Bodhisatta, the prince Siddhattha who later became the Buddha of our times. After his enlightenment beneath the Bodhi tree, he \textit{`revolved the Wheel' of the Dharma} (Dhamma-cakka-pavattana). This phrase has a definite meaning beyond the fact that he `taught Dharma'. The Wheel, seen on so many temples, images, sculptures, flags and so on throughout the Buddhist world, is a symbol of movement, something that is not static. Originally a symbol used by the greater Indian monarchs as a sign of their power and authority, it was tamed by the Buddha to represent the power for good of the Dharma which would increase both in its exterior presence in this world through such things as temples, monks and nuns, but increase also in the student's mind for his or her comfort. Unlike the usual run of royalty (and these days, presidents) Dharma conquers not by violence but through its innate truthfulness, through its advocation of loving- kindness and compassion. The Wheel of Dharma always revolves because that truthfulness is always true though the present Buddha's teaching of it may in time be forgotten. Hence it is known as the `Saccadhamma' — the truthful Dharma which applies everywhere and at all times. A Buddha may be said to the wheel a heave to keep it running!\\

The phrase under discussion here occurs three times in this Sutta and has been rendered as \textit{`revolve the wheel', `turn the Dharma-wheel} and \textit{revolution of the noble wheel'}\\

\textit{Lunar Lord} a few verses further on is a fancy name for the moon and his herding of the stars through the sky - charming poetry.\\

The panoply of state, the \textit{parasols} held above rulers and the yak-tail ﬂy-whisks and so on that traditionally accompany a rajah — possibly now found only in Thailand- are pictured in these verses, an ancient tradition indeed. The author was a bhikkhu in Thailand at the time of King Bhumibol Adulyadej's Fourth Cycle 4 x 12 = 48 years old) when he processed round the capital with right royal traditional splendour. All shops were closed and no one gazed out from upstairs windows or balconies but pavements were packed and silent with no cheering or clapping. The procession of elephants with the king mounted upon the first accompanied by royal retainers in traditional Thai costume was very impressive. Such precious articles as parasols and whisks, as described in the Sutta, were much in evidence and solemnity of the occasion emphasized by the crowd's silence. It was broken only by a single walking official play a tiny instrument, the high notes of which were punctuated every few steps by the single beat together of twenty—four drums. Altogether an awe-inspiring event with the monarch dismounting from his massive elephant to visit the various temples upon his route and pay homage there.\\

Returning more strictly to the Sutta, note that the Buddha throughout Sn. is referred to as a \textit{Jina — Victor or Conqueror —} of whatever it is in ourselves which prevents the Seeing of things-as-they-really-are. This occurs here in a passage of narrative as the Buddha generally is not shown as calling himself by this title. (Jina is also used by Jains, that is followers of the Jinas, as a title for their supreme teachers). The Buddha however does refer to himself as a Tath\=agata One who has come from/gone to Thusness), or a Samana (One who's at peace/equanimous).\\

In the same narrative passage Asita enquires about the \textit{Silentness supreme}. This one translator's effort to render \textit{moneyya\"y}, an abstract noun connected with \textit{muni}, a sage. Other renderings are `best of sagehoods', `highest wisdom' and `still wisdom's crown', while the Pali has `moneyya\"y uttama\"y padam'. \textit{`Muni'} is a tricky word to translate into English. Its best known context in English is as an -epithet of the Buddha: Sakyamuni or Shakyamuni. In P\=ali it is Sakiyamuni and usually translated as Sage of the Sakiyas. It is also well-known in a Sanskrit mantra: Om muni muni mah\=amuni sakyamuniye svaha. In this book muni is translated, `Sage'.\\

But to say this does not exhaust the meaning of muni which cannot in fact be translated by one word. This is because the root of this word is also connected to silence — the deliberate Hindu practice of not-speaking, and hence to the development of wisdom. In the Vinaya-pitaka an incident is recorded in which some bhikkhus make a pact not to speak to each other during their three months of Rains-retreat. When this was finished and they journeyed to meet the Buddha he enquired how they had practised and they told him of their deliberate silence: he reproved them for this, calling their practice acting like animals. They should not behave so but should communicate, he said, gladdening each other with Dharma. This silent practice in Skt. is called mauna or in P\=ali mona. It seems that the Buddha disapproved of this common Indian practice counting it as an extreme action not fitting those who practised the Middle Way. It is obviously different if solitary meditators practise silence. This sort of silence, \textit{moneyya\"y} or \textit{mona}, is really inner silence, not struggling with oneself not to talk, naturally not talking if there is no good reason to do so and it arises from a kind of wisdom gone beyond words. This kind of wisdom is expressed through the verb `mun\=ati' - to be one-with-silent-wisdom, or a mum, a silent sage. All this should be borne in mind (!) when the word `sage' is seen in this translation.\\

Coming to vs. 75, note its last line, \textit{`kill not nor cause to kill.'} Similar theme and the same refrain is found in Dhp. 129-130.\\

The next verse in P\=ali contains the word `cakkhum\=a'or `one~with-vision' which is literally one-with-eyes. See the A. Sutta, Threes, 29.\\

Shortly we arrive at vs. 714 which is accompanied in my manuscript translation with an exclamatory, Note! This is a warning that this difﬁcult verse is translated in different ways by E.M Hare, H. Saddhatissa, K.R. Norman with I.B Homer, as well as W. Rahula, and N.A. jayawickrama. Some of these versions though they have been printed make no sense or are mere literal versions word by word. One or two of them resort to the P\=ali Comy's involved `explanation'. The present translation tries to make sense of the P\=ali, (could there be an ancient corruption?) just as it stands.\\

The first line contains the word `ucc\=ava\"y' which most of the above translators have rendered `high and low'. However, as this refers to Dharma practices, while `high' ones does not sound out of place, surely it is inappropriate to talk of `low' ones. hence my translation of `refined and basic'.\\

The Samana in the second line is the Buddha talking modestly of himself, since samana was a common term for wandering monks. But this samana did not just teach these two types of practices but made them clear, clarified them or illuminated them. The P\=ali vb. `pak\=asita' has this meaning of shining, clarifying.\\

The second two liens have confounded all the above translators and the only advantage of this one is that it does make sense, though whether it represents the original meaning will be for future scholars to decide. The words `diguna\"y' and `ekaguna\"y' have, in the previous translations, been rendered `twice' and `once' but I have used `both' and `one' which makes better sense. Now, I assume that the verse concerns the two sorts of practice mentioned in the first two lines. The second two seem to mean that practitioners, only referred to with `they', do not go to the Beyond, that is Liberation or Nirvana, by means of either, both sorts of practices, nor with only one sort. What does this mean? This explanation seems best: some people think that only one sort of practice is needed — either the refined or the basic; others assume that both are required, the refined and the basic. Both these people hold a view about practice and while they do so neither will successfully find the Beyond. They will not find it as they have not let go of their views.\\

But even this explanation still begs the question: what is basic practice and what, refined? Asking this question assumes that `ucc\=avaca' has this meaning of high/low, or basic/refined. It can also mean `various'. Basic (or `low') might refer to the various ways of making merit ***???(puiwa)***??? — for these see Tens Ways of Making Merit (dasa-puiwa-kirya-vatthu) in the Comy to the Ud\=ana, or in the ﬁfth chapter of the Up\=asakajan\=ala\"ykara. Both works can be obtained from the P\=ali Text Society but neither has been translated. ln any case, no practitioner of Dhra1a can dispense with making good karma which of course involves kindness and compassion.\\

If making good karma, (puiwa) or merit, counts as basic practice what then would be the refined? Many would think that the more subtle types of practice would qualify, such as vipassan\=a or insight meditation or, outside Therav\=ada, refined samadhi experience in Ch'an/Zen, or tantric methods mostly found in Tibetan Buddhist sects, or of course Dzogchen. But then if these are designated as `refined' practices and thought of in that light with respect to oneself will it not sound like conceit? Selfless practice would be best.\\

`in all directions ten' (dasa-disa) is often used in verse to mean everywhere, all round, in every direction (vs. 719). In the same verse there is `growing in faith and modesty'. Modesty (hiri) has been commented on in the Notes following the Hiri Sutta (Sn. 253-Z57). Upon saddh\=a it needs only be said that the English translation of this as `faith' is not very accurate. The English word is, after all, used in Christian contexts where one is expected to believe, in some cases without question, whatever the church asserts to be true. But Buddhists call such beliefs `views' which unqualified by any adjectives always means `wrong views' — simple because they are not or cannot be questioned. So saddha in Buddhist teachings means more like `confidence' which deepens with practice and is balanced by wisdom (pa\~n\~na/praj\~na). Saddha would be ill-translated by `belief'.\\

In the line before this there is the word m\=amaka, literally `one who make mine' but meaning `one who loves me' or is `devoted to me'. The person with saddh\=a makes the Buddha his or her own and cannot be shaken from his teaching.

\section{The famous word `K\=ama'}

First, we can consider its range of meaning, a range which no one word in English can cover. As it is a very important word, used in so many different ways, there are only two choices to make in its translation. We may choose not to translate it letting the context of its use bring out its sense but this has the disadvantage that its meaning may not be revealed in full. ln this Sutta-nip\=ata translation I have not chosen this alternative. The second of these is to use appropriate and different English words to render the various meanings of `K\=ama'. This also has a disadvantage as the full range of this word is not apparent if one reads only English. This note, then is to bring out these varied meanings of `K\=ama' as well as drawing attention to compound words in P\=ali of which `K\=ama' is part. \\

\underline{K\=ama meaning `desire'.} This means `desire based on the senses'. A sense-object is seen (heard, etc.), by way of the organ of the eye or ear (no problem so far!), it registers in the mind and is identified with a name (this is the operation of sauna which includes memory as part of perception (still no trouble!). Then desire — k\=ama — may arise wanting that which has been perceived. This is where we may have difficulties — maybe we get what we want but still are not satisfied (though all sense-objects are impermanent), or we don't get it and so suffer in another way. K\=ama as sense-desire is very much tied up with my idea of my self, so even its fulfilment is a limitation. Desires of this kind, as we learn from so many places in the P\=ali Suttas, are compared to a blazing fire. Stoke up the fires of desire and suffer even more!. Our materialistic culture with its unending advertisements stokes these fires and in doing so feeds the fires, so that the sufferings of no peace, satisfaction of true happiness can be had in the long run.\\

Of course, as with the English word `desire' — it may be used in good beneficial contexts — so the word `k\=ama' also stretches to cover beneficial matters. One may desire the Dharma and in P\=ali one would be spoken of as `dhammak\=amo'. One may also desire the benefit of others, even their Liberation — this desire also falls under the word `k\=ama'. People sometimes ask, `But can I say that I desire Nirv\=ana?'. A reply to this might be that at the beginning of Buddhist study and practice one may desire to experience Nirv\=ana but as practice progresses the desire for that fades away as the Path to it and Nirv\=ana meld together.\\

Sense-desires are very varied, some very refined (as desire for sublimely peaceful states of mind), and some much grosser (as with eating delicious food, or of course for sex). In the latter contexts it is appropriate to use the words `sensual' and `sensuality' as translations of k\=ama, and when k\=ama is part of the compound `k\=amar\=aga', sex and sexual are definitely indicated. Raga by itself and combined with k\=ama- indicates `lust'.\\

\underline{K\=ama as sense-objects, the world of k\=ama.} So far k\=ama as a component of mind has been mentioned, but the word also stretches to include the variegated nature of sense objects. In this translation of Sn. 50 in The Rhino's Horn you will find —

\begin{MyDescription}[]{}
Sense-desires so varied, sweet,\\
in divers forms disturb the mind,\\
Seeing the bane of sense—desires\\
Fare singly as the rhino's horn.
\end{MyDescription}
   
This translation emphasizes sense-desires as an aspect of k\=ama. But it can also be translated —
   
\begin{MyDescription}[]{}
Things of sense so varied, sweet\\
in divers forms disturb the mind,\\
When danger's seen in things of sense\\
Fare singly as the rhino's horn.
\end{MyDescription}

`Things of sense' (Vatthuk\=ama) emphasizes the array of objects known by the way of eye, ear, nose, tongue and sense of touch. For a person with no sense-restraint they disturb the mind. English has no one word which will stretch over both the interior sense-desire and the exterior sense-objects. There are many examples of translators using the wrong meaning of the work k\=ama in their works.\\

Beyond desires and things of sense there is also k\=ama as enjoyment, sense-pleasure, sensuality/sexuality. In general, Theravada Buddhist teachings counsel that one should restrain one's senses and not indulge in this aspect of k\=ama. However, the Suttas have been preserved by bhikkus and emphasize their attitude to sense-restraint. Lay people in traditional Theravada countries tend to disregard this and enjoy life, unless there are secluding themselves for Dharma-practice as on the Uposatha days (full moon or new moon) or on a longer meditation retreat.\\

Turning away from k\=ama as in a monastic life, is very different from its natural enjoyment. The first is emphasized by the P\=ali K\=ama Sutta, the second by the Hindu (Sanskrit) K\=ama Sutra. In this book and other Hindu works on k\=ama the meaning of this word is not confined as some think, to sexual enjoyment. In fact they have treatises on civilized and refined enjoyment of all the senses: music ﬁt for the time of day and the persons present, gardens and ﬂower-arrangements, food and different sorts of incense, and so on. None of these things from a Buddhist viewpoint are in any way wrong or evil — they are just beautiful parts of this world — `things of sense so varied, sweet.' Whether they disturb the mind or not depends on how much Dharma-practice one has done. One who has gone far on the Path according to Theravada sources seems to be a person no longer interested in sense-objects, having few desires and little or no enjoyment in the different aspects of k\=ama. This suggests a rather dour character, serious and unsmiling. But the monastic Teachers that I have me usually had an excellent sense of humour, and some of them with their very earthy stories, had their audience roaring with laughter.\\

A rather different approach to k\=ama is found in some Tibetan Buddhist teachings such as Dzogchen. Here the array of sense-objects are looked upon as the ornaments of the world we live in. These ornaments are to be offered (which implies we let go of them, thus not controlling them but not renounce them), along with everything else: form (=body), sound, smell, taste, touch, the whole range of dharmas (=mind). The five great nectars, blood, that which arises from the fusion of the last two, the Awakened Heart, the `wheel' of practice — all offered infinitely. ln this tradition, all aspect of k\=ama, within the mind as desires outside in the world as sense-objects, and the enjoyments depending on them are to be integrated without the usual judgements — of this is good or that is bad. This allows what is repressed in mind to be liberated along with all the Qualities praised in the Dharma. Actions which would bring about the suffering of others through this process of integration are avoided by the samaya or relationship one has with Teachers and fellow-practitioners.

\newpage

\section{Reflections on the Jar\=a Sutta}

\begin{enumerate}


\item `Short indeed is this life.' When young the days are long and life has infinite possibilities —-. we think. Death then is something that happens to others, not to us. As we grow older live passes by more rapidly ﬁlled with many pleasures, pains and responsibilities. But when really old we remark that `l don't know where that week (or month or year) has gone'. So even with modern medical facilities `within a hundred years one dies'. Some do live longer but the Buddhist emphasis, contrary to the medical view supports only that the body should be kept alive as long as possible, is that A yu (long-life) should be accompanied and guided by j\~nana (clarity of mind or wisdom).

\item `Seeing' impermanence is very important, not just occasionally through the loss of dear people or possessions but deeply and thoroughly in one's heart through the arising and passing of thoughts whether they are holy ones or those based on greed, hatred and delusion — all should be known as impermanent. Whether this experience results in dwelling homeless or not depends upon one's circumstances. And the homelessness of the bhikkhu or bhikkhuni will not suit everybody. A kind of homelessness may be lived in a household life when there is little or no `mine-making' (mama\=ukara). This however presupposes that there is no longer the tendency to `l-making' (ah\=ink\=ara).

\item People often think that their possessions, in which they may include their bodies and some aspects of their minds which they are glad to own, are really theirs in spite of the message of the death of uncountable trillions of human beings in the distant and recent past. `You can't take it with you when you go' is a piece of valuable folk-wisdom though many try to exercise control of their wealth from beyond the grave. Buddhist tradition is to give away wealth and possessions before one dies — at least one makes some good karma by such generosity, while `western' traditions generally emphasize making a will which leaves to executors the task of allotting bequests to friends and relatives of the deceased. This is not the best way of disposing of so called `possessions'.

\item Seeing life as a dream, not as real and substantial, is a very helpful practice. Even when it is regarded as real, solid and so on grasping is possible even through one is grasping at more illusions:

\begin{MyDescription}[(The Diamond-cutter-Vajracchedika Sutra)]{}
As stars, a fault of vision, as a lamp,\\
A magic show, as rain-cloud, as a bubble,\\
as dream, a lightning-strike, as drops of dew,\\
like this should be viewed all that is conditioned.
\end{MyDescription}
The illusive is less easily grasped and letting-go becomes easier. `Departed and done their time': those departed (peta) have literally `done their time' (K\=alakatain), so it is not only those in gaol but all of us captured by the desires and pleases of sams\=ara\\
- we are still doing our time.\\

\item This well~known verse used in obituaries and the like in Buddhist countries underlines how frail our self-importance is. As we live now we have so many connections with others and perhaps our names are well-known, even famous. After death our fame fades away and as generation succeeds generation others' knowledge of us grows less and less till even mighty rulers are little more than half-forgotten names. Who now knows what sort of person King Asoka was and how he conducted his court and treated his wives? We know him mostly from his famous Edicts carved upon rocks, while even Buddhist legends about him are less reliable and open to question in many ways. If such a mighty ruler's fame will fade in only two thousand years or so, what remembrance will there be of our own small doings in a tenth of that time?

\item No one is truly secure because of many and expensive possessions. Security comes from letting-go, both of persons and possessions `out there', and to grasping 'one's own' body and mind.

\item `In being he'll not be seen again' means that as a bhikkhu practicing Dharma in solitude with a non-roaming mind, one which is secluded from distractions, he (but this applies equally to female practitioners) will not reappear in birth and death free from the Wheel of being or becoming.\\

\item `The sage is unsupported' — he or she has no need of supports, no need to lean on anything, not even persons, on institutions, upon dogmas or sectarian commentaries, not even upon the wise and Enlightened. And why? No props are necessary for those who have reached the Further Shore and no raft either. Such unstained sages are compared to the leaves of tropical plants which shed the rain falling on them immediately and so are not ravelled in sorrow and avarice.\\

\item Lotus plants, both leaves and flowers, have a soapy covering so water does not lay upon them at all. This is the basis for many references in the Buddha's teachings to lotuses and their purity. Hence they are never stained, not by the mud in which they grow nor by any pollution in the rain or atmosphere. All that rolls off and does not adhere to the surface. Sages are like that.\\

\item Not conceiving upon the seen, heard and sense for this is a common human activity, relying on no senses at all must seem strange. Even stranger is the fact that they do not `conceive', meaning that they have no conceit. (This play upon related words occurs also in P\=ali with the verb malwati (****???***) and the noun m\=ana). So in the sage there is no measuring of him or herself against either people — there is no `I am superior', `I am equal' or `I am inferior' for this is what conceit means in the Buddhadharma. The sage knows that purity comes from the heart and so could be neither attached, on the side of greed, nor displeased, on hatred's side.

\section{Verse by verse Commentary on this Sutta.}

\begin{enumerate}


l. This Sutta's `disadvantages' of sex for a Dharma—practitioner makes a rather strange list:
\begin{MyDescription}[]{}
one becomes forgetful of the teachings\\
others blame a celibate who later turns or returns to sex\\
less of fame and reputations due to the last\\
fantasies and brooding increase (= more moha-delusion).
\end{MyDescription}

These are dealt with below.

\begin{MyDescription}[]{}
My list of disadvantages is rather more practical:\\
possible entanglements which are difficult to get out of\\
less opportunity for (meditation) practice in a relationship\\
exhaustion from work and family.
\end{MyDescription}

It is much better to emphasize the advantages of the Good Life as a celibate rather than listing supposed or real disadvantages: 

\begin{MyDescription}[]{}
time and place available for practice if a monk/nun\\
livelihood comparatively easy\\
celibate practitioners and honoured and supported\\
mind may be un burdened from many worldly problems.
\end{MyDescription}

The P\=ali word used in this verse: \textit{methuna} means both sexual intercourse and sexuality generally.

\item Why would a person in a relationship necessarily be `forgetful of the S\=asana' (teaching)? This is a bit similar to present day Thai ideas of a bhikkhu who is believed to have lost or cast aside his Dharma knowledge at the time of his disrobing, a sort of `lose robes, lose Dharma'. Such a person is said to practice wrongly and does what is not Ariyan. This word presumably means `what is not of the Noble Ones', and is not a racial reference. Still, these Noble Ones include all who have true insight into the Dharma from Stream-winners to Arahats. In the later list of the ten fetters (sa\=yyojana) the first two of these, stream winner and once-returner, still (have lust and so can have sex, while the Non-returner cannot due to lack of sexual desire, while Arahats are well beyond such worldly matters. This scheme of listing which fetters disappear with each attainment seems very artificial and inadequate. Now in the present verse since sex is labelled as ignoble and no reference made to the (later?) four stages of Noble insight, it seems that any sexual relationship must, by anyone, be looked down upon.

\item That Dharma cannot include the love of a partner is emphasized in this verse. `Fared on (the verb `carati'— see introductory section) alone' means the celibate life either as a lay person, or as a monk/nun. Judgement by others that one is now `low' having given this up, is still very much alive in Sri Lanka. `Swerving off the track' might be true for some: a young American bhikkhu who disrobed after some years as a forest monk comes to mind. He plunged into the varied fleshpots of Bangkok. But this would not be the pattern for most people whose progress in the Dharma may need a partner. Rather than denigrating sex, as this Sutta tries to do, it would be an improvement to admit that the path of many great and noble people in this world has been made possible through the support that they receive from their partners. After all, love must be an ingredient, a very important one, upon every spiritual path. Certainly there can be love without sex but the combination of the two is even more powerful. Not all Buddhist traditions involve celibacy, notably of course tantric varieties of the Dharma. Their approach is conceivably saner and lacks the rather shrill tone of this Sutta's denial of sexuality. This verse is an appeal based on love of status: having reached `renown and fame' as a celibate practitioners, perhaps as a Chao Khum (Thailand), Sayadaw (Bunna), Mahathera Sri Lanka), suddenly by disrobing one becomes ordinary. The argument seems to be: remain celibate, have no sex, so that `renown and fame' are preserved. What kind of argument is this!

\item This is a verse of warning: think lustful thoughts and as a result brood upon the conflict of having these within a life of celibacy, leading to guilt and depression. But this practitioner seems not to know much Dharma. There are all the contemplations of the impermanence of the body and its inevitable decay, eventually becoming a fearsome sight with an indescribable stench (see l, l I, the Vijaya Sutta) as well as reflections on non-self and emptiness. All thoughts whether wholesome or unwholesome are empty of any essence, they have no owner, so who is getting depressed or feeling guilty? They arise and pass away due to conditioning and there is no one who can force them to disappear. Obsession with thoughts of sex and guilt for thinking them are signs that one needs to practise more the methods mentioned above. As for others' reproach, well, some even people always criticize the most virtuous, an even slander them. Remember! the Buddha said that there is no one who cannot be blamed for even he himself was an object of blame (See Dhp. Verse 22 7). If one listened to every slur and took it to heart, one would never practice Dharma.

\item Creating `arms' or weapons for punishing oneself on the basis of \underline{others'} reprimands continues the topic of the last verse. These reprimanding words uttered y other people, instead of letting them go, are used by self-hatred as `weapons' to beat oneself up, to lower one's self-esteem. In this case, one's conceit of oneself, the way one conceives of oneself, is 'I am inferior' and my inferiority compared with others is increasing. Others are viewed as `superior to myself' or perhaps as `equal to myself'. Having low self esteem makes it easier to do things which as they multiply drag my self-conceit even lower. `Sinking down into untruthfulness' means that one's actions (karmas) of mind, speech and body depart increasingly from the truth of the Dharma. Cure: an effort to make all sorts of good karma beginning with simple things: offerings of food to teachers and to the poor, speaking kind words to those who suffer, being helpful to those who need it, etc. Then pages of chanting Dharma every day, and eventually begin to practice meditation. Do not try to do the difficult meditation practices first.

\item{Another warning verse about losing reputation. Same person, with robes or other marks of celibacy and one is praised as wide, without them and sexually active and one's a fool. Like the last verse this one is concerned with the Eight Worldly Dharmas, principally the dark sides of the pairs: loss, disrepute, blame and suffering (dukkha). For these see, the Mangala Sutta (11.4) Commentary. The author of this verse assuming that it is not the Buddha, has not considered that the subject here is `well-known as wise' so he or she will not be at all upset by others derision. A truly wise person has equanimity (upekh\=a) so that his or her mind could not be shaken.

\item This verse continues from the last and is another appeal to self-pride and cherishing one's image — not the most Buddhist attitude surely!

\item The training of oneself in solitude is good for some people at some times. In Buddhist traditions it has never been compulsory and it is nonsense to assert as this verse does, that the Noble Ones' life is solitary or always spent in the woods. Some who are ennobled by the Dharma may chose to spend their lives in the forest but others may dwell in cities to help those who have difficulties there. The second two lines of the verse are very true indeed: the Noble Ones have no conceit of themselves as the `best' but then they have no conceit at all, hence the mention of Nirvana.

\item The last verse is another appeal for celibacy: that on will be envied `by those enmeshed with pleasures of sense'. That a practitioner should stand firm in celibacy for this reasons strikes on as very peculiar. 
\end{enumerate}

This odd Sutta could only have originated from the Buddha if one allows that he could have `off' days. But this would mean that he was only Buddha sometimes, while at others he would have been unenlightened! Not a Buddhist consideration! It is better to regard this Sutta as the work of some rather unenlightened monks, defending their own status but despising those Dharma-followers who led a household life. How it got included in the Sn. ls a problem now insoluble.\\

 We are told by the P\=ali Comy. That this Tissa Metteyya and the young Brahmin of the same name who appears at Ns. 1040 are not the same person. The Comy. Does relate a story as the background for this Sutta thought its details do not sound very convincing.

\newpage

\section{The two opening verses of this Sutta}
In the first line of the first verse we are presented with a statement that sex and lust with longing had been seen — but by who? And in what way had they been seen? This Sutta does not identify who has spoken these words. The verse continues with some very scornful words about someone's body though we are not told` whose.\\

The second verse is obviously spoken by another person who concludes with an interesting question, or rather, a series of them. The P\=ali still fails to identify either of these persons. Only in the third verse do we discover that the first verse is supposed to be spoken by the Buddha and the second by his supposed questioner, M\=agandiya.\\

These two verses are worthy of closer examination as they present a number of puzzling questions. The first of these concerns the three nouns: craving, longing and lust which as aspects of mind must always concern those living a celibate life. So are they just that — three troublesome mind-states? The answer to this is that in a few Suttas and P\=ali Comys these three have become a potent aspect of M\=ara's assault upon the potential Buddha while he was seated under the Bodhi tree just before his Awakening. This assault is mentioned in Sn. 425-440 where such mind-aspects and sense-desires, fear and hard heartedness are personalized into soldiers in Mara's army. ln the same way, craving, longing and lust are transformed into the famous Daughters of Mara. `Famous' because generations of Buddhist artists have delighted in portraying their seductive forms and alluring gestures upon walls and in manuscripts, while monks have also enjoyed elaborating  upon this story. Of course, in the various accounts of this incident in both P\=ali and Sanskrit, the Daughters of Mara are defeated because the Buddha cannot be seduced by them. lf we understand this line to refer to the three gorgeous girls, we must capitalize their names, but not do the same for the verb `seen' which would mean that the Buddha had only seen them been aware of them as sight—objects but taken no interest. On the other hand if they are personalized mind-states then they do not merit capitalized names but the verb `Seen' should have a capital letter to indicate that insight or vipassan\=a regarding lust and so on. It is worth noting that though the Daughters of Mara legend occurs in the classic P\=ali Comys, it is rarely found in the Suttas. So much for the first line!\\

According to the Suttas supported by the Comys, sexual desire is eliminated with the attainment of refined aspects of the paths and fruits. The Buddha and his Arahat disciples are depicted in the Vinaya and Sutta as having gone beyond sex and so having no longer to struggle to maintain celibacy, having in fact none of me problems that most people have with sexuality. This systematized view, slowly becoming known as `Theravada', promoted the growth of celibate sanghas of monks and nuns some of whom emphasized that only those in robes could reach the more refined stages of liberation. Ordinary practitioners could not become Arahats and if by some strange collection of causes they did, either they would have to be ordained on that very day, or they would die! Though this seems most unlikely, it is opposed by the presence at A.Sixes 131-151 of a list of lay practitioners `who have Gone to the End, Seen the Deathless'. Some of them are familiar and others more obscure but in any case these present-day Buddhists who are not ordained should take heart and remember these heroes from so long ago. Their names `Tapussa, Bhallika, Sudatta An\=athap\=o\=oa, Citta Macci-K\=asandika, Hatthaka Alavaka, Mah\=an\=ama Sakka, Ugga Ves\=alika, S\=ara Ambattha, J\=avaka Kom\=arabhacca, Nakulapit\=a, Tavaka\=o\=oika, Pur\=ana, Isidatta, Sandh\=ana, Vijaya, Vajiiyamahita, Me\=o\=oaka, V\=asettha, Arittha, S\=aragga'. There are no women in this list. The survival of these men's names among P\=ali Suttas very full of teachings to and about the monastic sanghas with Liberation limited to only ordained people, is a small indication that in the Buddha's days liberation was available to all.\\

The last two lines of this verse contain words of scorn said to be uttered by the Buddha upon being presented with the beautiful M\=agandiy\=a, daughter of the brahmin M\=agandiy\=a. The Dhp. Comy provides details of this story which does not appear in any Sutta. The essence of this is as follows: M\=agandiy\=a rejected many offers of marriage for his daughter made by wealthy and powerful princes. However, upon seeing the footprints of the Buddha (note the connection with the Signs of the Superman — D30 and the remarks following Sn. 1031), was sure that he would be a suitable husband. After meeting the Buddha and offering him his daughter well-adorned the story continues with the popular account of the Buddha's Awakening in which Mara and his three daughters, Tanh\=a (craving), Arat\=a (longing) and R\=ag\=a (lust) — whose bodies are rumoured to surpass all human beauty try to upset the Bodhisattva's intention. This encounter is made the excuse for the future Buddha to scorn a mere human girl — M\=agandiya, with these words —

\begin{MyDescription}
`what then about this filled with piss and shit,\\
that even with food I'd not wish to touch!'
\end{MyDescription}

Now, all Buddhists hold that their Teacher was remarkable for his Great Compassion (Mah\=akarun\=a) towards every human being and the accounts of this life confirm this. The scornful words quoted above are said to have been spoken in the presence of M\=agandiya herself and hardly sound like compassionate talk! As it turned out in the Dhp Comy story these insulting words caused M\=agandiya — not surprisingly - to hate the Buddha and to seek her revenge on him by burning alive many of the ladies of the local king who were his disciples. So M\=agandiya showed herself as a very nasty piece of work who came to a grisly end. But could a Buddha act in such a way as to bring this about?\\

As there are a number of M\=adandiy\=as in the Suttas and Comys it may be that these have been confused so that fragments of their legends have been patched together by a misogynist monk who as put the above words in the Buddha's mouth. After this tangle, M\=agandiy\=a the Brahmin addresses to the Buddha a number of questions quite unrelated to what has gone before.\\

The first verse of this Sutta, Sn 835, is also found in the story-cycle of King Udena in Dhp Comy vol 1 P. 199ff of the English translation, Buddhist Legends.\\

Vs. 836: `in what kind of life'. `Life' translates `bhavaj' literally `being', `existence'.\\

Vs. 845: `N\=aga', literally a serpent or serpent-spirit connected with water. Worshipped to bring rain. Also an elephant, but here means a mighty Teacher.

   O Lord, do you explain this,

   The Signs of a Superman:
   A Commentary on Sn. 1000,1017, 1022
   Before this strange subject is examined, its cultural background needs
   reﬂection. Brahmins of the Aryan peoples who settled at ﬁrst in N.W lndia, had
   a great opinion of themselves. Though in times more ancient than that there had
   been women among them who were experts in rituals, knowing all the mantras,
   by the times of the Buddha all brahmin priest were men. As many of these
   priests after listening to the words of the Buddha became his disciples and many
   ordained as bhikkhus, they brought with them their underlying sense of male
   superiority. This has been transferred by them through chanting, to the Suttas.
   Among these brahminical relics are the strange legends of the Superman which
   within the Buddhadhama apply to only perfectly Awakened Buddhas and
   Dharma-wheel tuming emperors. Within Sn. It is interesting to notice that the
   verses we are concemed with appear in connection with brahmins. We should
   also be aware that there are other Suttas, for instance M.1 15.12 or
   A.0nes.XV.1-28, which raise the related subject of the lmpossibles, that lay
   down the law that women cannot be either Supennen as a Buddha, or as Dharma-
   emperor, ruling the entire world. The reasons why this is said to be is not made
   very clear. The Dhanna is said to be `just like this and not otherwise'.
   The list of 32 signs upon the bodies of a SLlp9lTI13l'l (ma/13-pun'sa~
   lakkhaaa) were, for those who knew how to read them, clear evidence of their
   MS Page:43B
   
   
   
   V.l 976-1031
   spiritual attainment — a vew sharp contrast to the Buddha's actual teachings.
   That they have survived for such a long time even into the present, is shown by
   newly-made images of the Buddha whose feet often have lotus-ﬂowers upon their
   soles. The prime source of the list of the 32 is found in the Long Discourses
   (Dagha (D)) 30 para 1.2). This sutta tries to explain in tenns of cause (kanna),
   effect (the physical `signs') the various and sometimes curious marks of the
   Supennan. The order of these signs in the following list differs from their
   explanation later in the D. Sutta. There appears to be little reason in this so-
   called cause and effect. Scholars have suggested that the Lakkhana Sutta (D.3O)
   is a later production by bhikkhus after the passing of the Buddha.
   The list of 32 signs follows with some comments.
   l. He has feet with level tread (This sounds like ﬂat footedness).
   2. On the soles of his feet are wheels with the thousand spokes, complete with
   felloe and hub (Seen on Buddha-images seated in Vaira-positions/full-lotus).
   3. He has projecting heels. (Occasional standing Buddha-images in Thailand
   have this).
   4. He has long ﬁngers and toes. (Sometimes in Buddha-images this is taken to
   mean that ﬁngers are of the same length, the same with toes).
   5. He has soft and tender hands and feet. (Thus maiking him of high caste.).
   6. His hands and feet are netlike. (Reticulation of veins under the skin).
   MS PIge:439
   
   
   
   V.1 976-1031
   7. He has high—raised ankles. (Short legs? Long feet?)
   8. His legs are like and antelope's. (Slender and well-shaped).
   9. Standing and without bending he can touch and rub his knees with either
   hand. (Results in ill-proportioned ape-like images).
   10. His male organs are enclosed in a sheath (The ﬁrst of Bavari's signs
   commented on below. Literally the Pali says: `ensheathed is the cloth-
   concealed' — devoid of meaning unless one knows what this euphemism
   hides).
   1 1. His complexion is bright, the colour of gold.
   12. His skin is delicate and so smooth that no dust can adhere to his body.
   13. His body-hairs are separate, one to each pore (is this not usual for
   humans?).
   14. His body-hairs grow upwards, each blue-black like collyrium (used as a
   cosmetic).
   15. His body is divinely straight.
   16. He has the seven convex surfaces.
   17. The front of his body is like a lion's.
   18. There is no hollow between his shoulders —— blades).
   MS Page 440
   
   
   
   V.l 976-I O31
   19. He is proportioned like a banyan tree (the height of the body is the same
   as the span of his outstretched am1s).
   20. His chest is evenly rounded.
   21. He has a perfect sense of taste (but how did others know this?).
   22. He has jaws like a lion's (but such jaws are for piercing and tearing!)
   23. He has 40 teeth. (But how could a normal human jaw accommodate
   them?)
   24. His teeth are even.
   25. There are no spaces between his teeth.
   26. His canine teeth are very bright.
   Z7. His tongue is very long (The second of Bavari's marks).
   28. He has a Brahma-like voice (like that of a karavika-bird).
   29. His eyes are deep blue.
   30. He has eyelashes like a cow's.
   3 l . The hair between his eyes is white and soft like cotton-down (the third of
   Bavari's marks).
   32. His head is like a royal turban. (That is, his head rises to a protuberance at
   the top of his head — see many Buddha-images).

   V.l 976-1031
   A supennan with even a few of these marks would be freakish to our eyes,
   even if only a male child. When grown it would hardly impress by its strange
   appearance, even though this was supposed to signify supen'or spirituality. The
   meanings of some signs are obscure though the Pali Comys try to provide
   convincing explanations. An example of this, which is rather important, is
   No.10: `ensheathed is the cloth~concealed.' Even when Pali Dictionaries have
   been consulted and `cloth-concealed' is revealed as male genitalia, we are no
   further towards understanding what `ensheathed' refers to. Saddhatissa's
   translation is rather coy with `the foreskin completely covers the phallus'. But
   such a rationalist rendering fails to make clear what could be wonderful about
   this! As marks of a Supennan, all of these thirty-two should be exceptional in
   some way, while to say that the male organ is sheathed by the foreskin is no more
   than indicating the ordinary man's equipment. Presumably both penis and testes
   are meant to be covered by a ﬂap of skin but then how could the fonner be used,
   even for urination? Do they have to be `ensheathed' because the supposed
   brahmin authors of this list were shy about making their meaning clearer? Or
   were the authors, Buddhist monks, similarly shy? The literal meaning sounds as
   though the Supemian had some sort of sexual abnormality which was
   undiscussable, puzzling when we remember that prior to Buddhahood, he
   procreated a son, Rahula, apparently nonnally. lt could be that celibate monks
   who suffered conﬂicts between a code of rules (the Patimokkha) and their 0Wl'l
   M5 |"zge:44Z
   
   
   
   V.l 976-1031
   sexuality thought it best to mystify the Buddha's body. But then, this effort to
   see as though through fog — 'ensheathed is the cloth-concealed' — hardly agrees
   with the Buddha's occasional revealing of his sexual organs to convince doubtful
   brahmins that he possessed all of the sign of a superman (see for example M.
   91.7). Whichever way this is regarded it is an unsolvable problem.
   Bavari's two other marks or signs present lesser problems. In the above
   translation of Sn. 1022 the ﬁrst line reads `Cover his face with his tongue he
   can,' certainly not an ordinary feat. If an explanation is needed then it may be
   noticed that some practitioners of yoga as part of a practice for limiting the
   ordinary way of breathing restrain this by cutting the ligament under the tongue,
   a frenum, so that the tongue can be tumed back into the throat. This would
   enable also the tongue to be extended further over the face.
   As for the second of these, `hair grows between his brows' this seems to
   be a hairy male. Buddha-images are found with this mark between the eyebrows.
   This is certainly not as special as the other two signs.
   l have followed the translation of this list by Maurice Walshe in his Dagha-
   nikaya, “Thus Have I heard", later re-issued as ”Long Discourses of the Buddha".
   My OWI1 explanations and exclamations follow in brackets.
   The list remains the only sutta passage to give an all-round account of what
   the Buddha may have looked like, apart from occasional references, mostly in
   verse, or his handsome features. See for instance the Sn. Verses 548-553 in this
   book which also mention `the signs peculiar to the Superman'.

   Notes on Sn. 1032 -I123
   1032. The world (citra) in ﬁrst line. The world as exterior is more often
   loka in Pali. But loka and citta are closely interrelated in Buddhist Suttas.
   1036. 1.3. Namer-mind: in Pali this is nama, what (that which?) gives .
   names to things. These two words, from Pali, and from English, are
   etymologically related.
   1040. The Tissametteyya who asks this question is unlikely to be the one
   who is addressed in lV. 7, or Sn. 814-823.
   1040. 1.3. Extremes (in views and practices) never approved by the
   Buddha. ln Pali anta (close to English 'end') is usually translated `extreme'.
   1040. A `great person' in the Buddhist sense, rather than the Hindu. See
   the Commentarial notes to Sn. 1000, 1017, 1022.
   1040. 1.3. Sibbaniji — seamstress. The seamstress who sews together
   saysara, the round of birth and death.
   1046. Some brahmins made offerings to gods in order to procure the
   results of sense/sex enjoyment.
   1062. Live a frugal life without indulgence or bodily self-toiture — either
   extreme.
   1061-1068. The Buddhas does not teach Dhotaka what he asks, so there
   are two possibilities; The text is lost or comipted, or, the Buddha taught with
   these few words which were accompanies by a mind-transmission.
   1070. Nothingness: the nature of all that can be conceived — no
   essence.
   Nothingness: one has no views about pennanence.
   Craving's exhaustion by night and by day, not `destruction'.
   1074. `Mind and body' in Theravada translated as `body-group' by some
   authors.
   1076. `Emptied' is better translation than `removed, destroyed or
   abolished' as used by Ven. Nyanamoli.
   MS Page 477
   
   
   
   l077. Muni was used by all practitioners of Dharma, not only Buddha.
   1078. `Fare' is the only English word meaning both joumey/travel as well
   as practice Dharma which is regarded as a ioumey. The verb `cavati' also has the
   two meanings of ordinary and spiritual joumeys.
   1079. The seen and the heard is placing reliance upon the ways that
   unimportant things are done (such as putting on robes) and not paying attention
   to really important matters (such as ageing and death).
   1083. The last line of this verse: is this Nanda's agreement with the
   Buddha or does this contain his conceit that he too has the same view?
   1084. Teaching or path or generally meaning religion. It is hard to ﬁnd
   an English word to ﬁt all the meanings of Sasana.
   1 100. Name and fonn: nama-rapa. Nama is mind generally, while rapa is
   body.
   l 105. `seated free of dust' —- refers to mental-emotional dust.
   l l l5. no-thingness: does not mean the arapa (fom1less) attainment in
   meditation. `brahmin' here in the Buddhist sense.
   l l 16. Twice the Buddha did not reply to Mogharaia. But the third time
   his mind had settled down. Suﬂna means emptiness of persons, ego, selfhood,
   ownership etc, it does not mean `nothing'.

   Epilogue: Pingzya's Praises of the Way to the Beyond
   The Radiant One said this while he stayed among the Magadhese at the
   Pasanika Shrine. There he was asked, then he questioned, the sixteen brahmin pupils,
   answering their questions. If one should understand the meaning of even one question
   and then practise the Dharrna according to the Dharma, then one Would go to the
   farther shore beyond ageing and death. As this Dhanna leads to the farther shore it is
   known as the Teaching leading to the Farther Shore (Parayana Sutta).
